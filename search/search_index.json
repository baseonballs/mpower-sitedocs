Foundations of Mathematics","text":"<p>At its core, logic provides the foundation upon which mathematical reasoning is built. Formal logic, as a branch of philosophy, deals with the principles of valid inference and reasoning. In mathematics, logic is used to construct formal systems that underpin various branches of mathematics, such as set theory, number theory, and geometry.</p> <p>Formal Systems: A formal system consists of a set of axioms and inference rules used to derive theorems. For example, Peano arithmetic, which formalizes the basic properties of natural numbers, relies on axioms and logical rules to derive arithmetic truths.</p> <p>Axioms and Proofs: Axioms are fundamental assumptions accepted without proof, while theorems are propositions proven based on these axioms. The process of proving theorems involves logical deduction, ensuring that conclusions follow necessarily from the premises.</p>"},{"location":"logic/intro/#2_types_of_logic_used_in_mathematics","title":"2. Types of Logic Used in Mathematics","text":"<p>Several types of logic are employed in mathematical reasoning:</p> <p>Propositional Logic: This is the simplest form of logic, dealing with propositions and their truth values. It forms the basis for more complex logical systems and is used to construct logical expressions and derive conclusions based on truth tables.</p> <p>Predicate Logic: Predicate logic extends propositional logic by dealing with predicates and quantifiers. It allows for the expression of statements involving variables and quantifiers, such as \"for all\" (universal quantifier) and \"there exists\" (existential quantifier).</p> <p>Modal Logic: Modal logic explores necessity and possibility, extending classical logic to include modal operators. This type of logic is used in areas such as mathematical proofs and philosophical discussions about necessity.</p> <p>Intuitionistic Logic: Intuitionistic logic, developed by L.E.J. Brouwer, differs from classical logic by emphasizing constructive proofs. In this framework, a statement is considered true only if there is a constructive method to verify it.</p>"},{"location":"logic/intro/#3_applications_of_logic_in_mathematics","title":"3. Applications of Logic in Mathematics","text":"<p>Logic plays a crucial role in various mathematical disciplines:</p> <p>Proof Theory: Proof theory studies the nature of mathematical proofs, focusing on the structure and justification of proofs. It helps in understanding the consistency and completeness of mathematical systems.</p> <p>Set Theory: Set theory, the study of collections of objects, relies heavily on logic to formalize concepts such as membership, subsets, and cardinality. It provides the foundation for much of modern mathematics.</p> <p>Computability Theory: This branch of mathematical logic explores what can be computed and how. It includes the study of algorithms, Turing machines, and the limits of computation.</p> <p>Model Theory: Model theory investigates the relationships between formal theories and their models, examining how mathematical structures satisfy the axioms of a given theory.</p>"},{"location":"logic/intro/#4_philosophical_implications","title":"4. Philosophical Implications","text":"<p>The interplay between logic and mathematics also raises important philosophical questions:</p> <p>Platonism vs. Formalism: Platonism views mathematical objects as abstract entities with an existence independent of human thought, while formalism treats mathematics as a set of symbols and rules manipulated according to formal systems.</p> <p>Consistency and Completeness: G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems demonstrate that any sufficiently complex formal system cannot be both complete and consistent. This has profound implications for the philosophy of mathematics and the limits of formal reasoning.</p>"},{"location":"logic/intro/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>Logic is the backbone of mathematical reasoning, providing the tools and principles needed to construct and validate mathematical theories.

A linear equation in two variables and b is the constant reflecting the y-intercept, often written in the form \\(y = mx + b\\), represents the equation of a line in the coordinate plane. Here, \\(m\\) represents the slope of the line, which determines its steepness, and \\(b\\) is the y-intercept, where the line crosses the y-axis.</p> <p>In the equation \\( y = mx + b \\), there are two variables: \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). The variable \\( y \\) is called the dependent variable because its value depends on \\( x \\), which is known as the independent or indeterminate variable. In other words, the value of \\( y \\) changes based on the value of \\( x \\). When \\( x \\) changes, \\( y \\) adjusts accordingly. This describes a one-to-one correspondence, where each value of \\( x \\) maps to a specific value of \\( y \\), expressed as \\( x \\to y \\). </p> <p>As such, the geometrical interpretation of linear equations reveals their simplicity: in one variable, the equation represents a point on a number line; in two variables, it represents a line in a plane. For three variables, the equation describes a plane in 3D space. This ability to visualize linear relationships makes them a cornerstone in the study of geometry and algebra.</p> <p>Linear equations help define important geometric concepts:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Slope: The slope, \\(m\\), is a geometric measurement of how much a line inclines or declines as it moves from left to right. In geometry, slope can also be seen as the ratio of the vertical change (rise) to the horizontal change (run) between any two points on the line.</p> </li> <li> <p>Intercepts: The y-intercept (\\(b\\)) and x-intercept (the point where \\(y = 0\\)) provide information about where the line crosses the axes. These intercepts are useful in understanding how the line interacts with the coordinate plane.</p> </li> <li> <p>Parallel and Perpendicular Lines: Linear equations describe the relationship between parallel and perpendicular lines. Two lines are parallel if they have the same slope (\\(m_1 = m_2\\)), and they are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is \\(-1\\) (\\(m_1 \\times m_2 = -1\\)).</p> </li> <li> <p>Distance and Midpoints: While not directly expressed through linear equations, the concepts of distance between two points on a line or finding the midpoint of a line segment can be derived using the coordinates of points on the line, which are solutions to the linear equation.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Linear equations form the backbone of geometric understanding in two-dimensional space, helping describe and analyze shapes, slopes, and lines in simple geometric figures.</p> <p>Before diving into the formalities of learning about the forms and structure of linear equations, let's take a moment to explore a powerful tool that will help you visualize and understand the key components of a line.

Here\u2019s how it can be used to support learning in this context:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Graphing Linear Equations: Desmos allows users to input linear equations, such as \\( y = mx + b \\), and instantly visualize their corresponding graphs. By adjusting the values of \\( m \\) (slope) and \\( b \\) (y-intercept), learners can see in real-time how these parameters affect the steepness and position of the line on the coordinate plane.</p> </li> <li> <p>Exploring Slope and Intercepts: The tool makes it easy to experiment with different slopes and intercepts. For example, students can manipulate the slope to see how parallel and perpendicular lines behave. By changing the intercept, they can observe how the line shifts vertically without altering its slope. This hands-on exploration reinforces the relationship between algebraic expressions and their geometric representations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Point-Slope and Slope-Intercept Forms: Desmos supports multiple forms of linear equations, such as point-slope form \\( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\) and slope-intercept form \\( y = mx + b \\). This versatility helps students explore how lines can be represented in different ways and understand the connections between these forms.</p> </li> <li> <p>Solving Systems of Linear Equations: Desmos makes it simple to plot multiple linear equations simultaneously, allowing students to visually explore solutions to systems of linear equations. They can see where two lines intersect, which represents the solution to the system.</p> </li> <li> <p>Real-Time Interaction: Desmos provides dynamic sliders for variables, allowing students to see how changes in one variable affect the line instantly. This encourages deeper exploration and helps students grasp abstract concepts through interactive learning.</p> </li> <li> <p>Modeling Real-World Problems: Students can use Desmos to model real-world situations with linear equations. For example, they can create equations that represent the cost of a product over time, distances traveled at a constant speed, or growth patterns, making the abstract concepts of linearity more tangible.</p> </li> <li> <p>Visualizing Geometric Concepts: Beyond just lines, Desmos can help visualize geometric shapes and figures where linear equations are involved, such as triangles, parallelograms, and their properties, by using the equations of lines to define boundaries or sides of the figures.</p> </li> </ol> <p>By combining visual feedback with interactivity, Desmos helps learners build a deeper understanding of the geometric and algebraic properties of lines and linear equations.

Understanding how to apply and manipulate these relationships can greatly simplify many algebraic problems.</p>"},{"location":"mathematics/a1/eqs/quadratics/problem-sets/completing-the-square/pset.cts.01/","title":"Problem Set: Completing the Square","text":""},{"location":"mathematics/a1/eqs/quadratics/problem-sets/completing-the-square/pset.cts.01/#probem_1","title":"Probem 1.","text":"<p>olve the quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0\\) by completing the square.</p>"},{"location":"mathematics/a1/eqs/quadratics/problem-sets/completing-the-square/pset.cts.01/#probem_2","title":"Probem 2.","text":"<p>Find the roots of the equation \\(x^2 + 8x + 15 = 0\\) using the method of completing the square.</p>"},{"location":"mathematics/a1/eqs/quadratics/problem-sets/completing-the-square/pset.cts.01/#probem_3","title":"Probem 3.","text":"<p>Solve the quadratic equation \\(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\\) by completing the square.</p>"},{"location":"mathematics/a1/eqs/quadratics/problem-sets/completing-the-square/pset.cts.01/#probem_4","title":"Probem 4.","text":"<p>Find the solutions to the equation \\(3x^2 - 12x + 7 = 0\\) using the completing the square method.</p>"},{"location":"mathematics/a1/eqs/quadratics/problem-sets/completing-the-square/pset.cts.01/#probem_5","title":"Probem 5.","text":"<p>Complete the square to solve \\(4x^2 + 20x + 25 = 0\\).</p>"},{"location":"mathematics/a1/eqs/quadratics/problem-sets/completing-the-square/pset.cts.01/#probem_6","title":"Probem 6.","text":"<p>Solve the quadratic equation \\(x^2 + 6x - 7 = 0\\) by completing the square.</p>"},{"location":"mathematics/a1/eqs/quadratics/problem-sets/completing-the-square/pset.cts.01/#probem_7","title":"Probem 7.","text":"<p>Find the roots of \\(x^2 - 10x + 24 = 0\\) using the method of completing the square.</p>"},{"location":"mathematics/a1/eqs/quadratics/problem-sets/completing-the-square/pset.cts.01/#probem_8","title":"Probem 8.","text":"<p>Solve \\(5x^2 + 14x - 3 = 0\\) by completing the square.</p>"},{"location":"mathematics/a1/eqs/quadratics/problem-sets/completing-the-square/pset.cts.01/#probem_9","title":"Probem 9.","text":"<p>Find the solutions to the quadratic equation \\(x^2 + 2x - 8 = 0\\) using the completing the square method.</p>"},{"location":"mathematics/a1/eqs/quadratics/problem-sets/completing-the-square/pset.cts.01/#probem_10","title":"Probem 10.","text":"<p>Complete the square to solve \\(6x^2 - 5x - 6 = 0\\).</p>"},{"location":"mathematics/a1/eqs/quadratics/problem-sets/completing-the-square/pset.cts.01/#probem_11","title":"Probem 11.","text":"<p>Solve the quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 8x + 16 = 0\\) by completing the square.</p>"},{"location":"mathematics/a1/eqs/quadratics/problem-sets/completing-the-square/pset.cts.01/#probem_12","title":"Probem 12.","text":"<p>Find the roots of \\(2x^2 + 4x - 3 = 0\\) using the completing the square method.</p> <p>Click here for the solutions.</p>"},{"location":"mathematics/a1/eqs/quadratics/problem-sets/completing-the-square/pset.cts.01.sol/","title":"Pset.cts.01.sol","text":""},{"location":"mathematics/a1/eqs/quadratics/problem-sets/completing-the-square/pset.cts.01.sol/#completing_the_square_solutions_-_set_1","title":"Completing the Square Solutions - Set 1","text":""},{"location":"mathematics/a1/eqs/quadratics/problem-sets/completing-the-square/pset.cts.01.sol/#problem_1","title":"Problem 1.","text":"<p>Equation: \\(x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0\\)</p> <p>Steps:</p> <ol> <li>Rewrite the equation: \\(x^2 - 6x = -5\\).</li> <li>Complete the square:</li> </ol> \\[ x^2 - 6x + \\left(\\frac{6}{2}\\right)^2 = -5 + \\left(\\frac{6}{2}\\right)^2 \\] \\[ x^2 - 6x + 9 = 4 \\] \\[ (x - 3)^2 = 4 \\] <ol> <li>Solve for \\(x\\):</li> </ol> \\[ x - 3 = \\pm 2 \\] \\[ x = 3 \\pm 2 \\] \\[ x = 5 \\text{ or } x = 1 \\]"},{"location":"mathematics/a1/eqs/quadratics/problem-sets/completing-the-square/pset.cts.01.sol/#problem_2","title":"Problem 2.","text":"<p>Equation: \\(x^2 + 8x + 15 = 0\\)</p> <p>Steps:</p> <ol> <li>Rewrite the equation: \\(x^2 + 8x = -15\\).</li> <li>Complete the square:</li> </ol> \\[ x^2 + 8x + \\left(\\frac{8}{2}\\right)^2 = -15 + \\left(\\frac{8}{2}\\right)^2 \\] \\[ x^2 + 8x + 16 = 1 \\] \\[ (x + 4)^2 = 1 \\] <ol> <li>Solve for \\(x\\):</li> </ol> \\[ x + 4 = \\pm 1 \\] \\[ x = -4 \\pm 1 \\] \\[ x = -3 \\text{ or } x = -5 \\]"},{"location":"mathematics/a1/eqs/quadratics/problem-sets/completing-the-square/pset.cts.01.sol/#problem_3","title":"Problem 3.","text":"<p>Equation: \\(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\\)</p> <p>Steps: 1.

Encourage them to ask \"why\" and \"how\" questions about the world around them. You can use the following methods:</p> <ul> <li>Wonder Walls: Create a space where students can post questions they\u2019re curious about, and work together to find answers.</li> <li>Research Projects: Let students investigate topics of interest and present their findings.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Teach Through Games and Puzzles    Use logic games, puzzles, and problem-solving activities to engage students in critical thinking.

Guide them to listen to others, challenge ideas respectfully, and support their arguments with evidence.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use Stories and Scenarios    Present scenarios through storytelling where students must think critically about the characters\u2019 decisions. Example questions include:</p> <ul> <li>\u201cWas the character\u2019s decision the best one?

The number 1 is the only number that cannot be made by adding or multiplying any other whole numbers together. It\u2019s a unique number in the world of math! </li> </ol> <p>Explaination</p> <p>The number 1 is unique because you can't create it by adding or multiplying any other whole numbers (other than 1 itself) together. </p> <p>For example:</p> <ol> <li>Adding Whole Numbers:</li> <li> <p>If you try to add whole numbers to get 1, you will see that you cannot achieve this with any combination other than using the number 1 itself. For instance, \\(0 + 1 = 1\\), but 0 is not a positive whole number.</p> </li> <li> <p>Multiplying Whole Numbers:</p> </li> <li>When you multiply whole numbers, you always get results larger than 1, or 0 if you multiply by 0. For instance, \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\), and \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\). None of these products is 1.</li> </ol> <p>The only way to get the number 1 using multiplication is \\(1 \\times 1\\), but this does not involve combining different whole numbers\u2014it just uses the same number. Thus, 1 stands alone as a unique number in this sense.</p> <ol> <li>Did you know? If you add up all the numbers from 1 to 100, you get 5050. This is thanks to a clever young mathematician named Carl Friedrich Gauss who figured this out when he was just 8 years old! </li> </ol> <p>Explaination</p> <ol> <li>Understanding the Problem:</li> <li> <p>You want to find the sum of all whole numbers from 1 up to 100.</p> </li> <li> <p>Using Gauss's Formula:</p> </li> <li>Gauss's method involves pairing numbers. For instance, if you list the numbers from 1 to 100 forward and backward:      <code>1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 100      100 + 99 + 98 + ... + 1</code></li> <li> <p>Each pair (1 + 100, 2 + 99, 3 + 98, etc.) adds up to 101. There are 50 such pairs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Formula Approach:</p> </li> <li>The formula Gauss used for the sum of the first \\( n \\) positive integers is:</li> </ol> \\[ \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n \\times (n + 1)}{2} \\] <ul> <li> <p>Here, \\( n \\) is 100.</p> </li> <li> <p>Calculate Using the Formula:</p> </li> <li>Plug \\( n = 100 \\) into the formula: </li> </ul> \\[ \\text{Sum} = \\frac{100 \\times 101}{2} = \\frac{10100}{2} = 5050 \\] <p>So, the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 is indeed 5050, thanks to Gauss's clever method!</p> <ol> <li> <p>Did you know? There are infinitely many prime numbers! A prime number is a number greater than 1 that can only be divided by 1 and itself. The number 2 is the only even prime number!</p> </li> <li> <p>Did you know?
