# Newton's First Law: Law of Inertia

Newton's First Law is a great example of direct proportionality, and we’ll use it as a case study for real-world problem-solving in applied mathematics. What’s especially beneficial is that we don’t need complex algebra; we can address these scenarios using simple elementary math. By applying one of the fundamental physical laws, we can explore the relationship between distance and time. Intuitively, as time increases, we expect the distance traveled to increase as well. Likewise, with decreased time, the distance covered should be less. 

The key is to understand the relationships between the main parameters — *distance*, *velocity*, and *time* — within the context of Newton's First Law. This makes for a valuable problem because it highlights the linearity between the two variables, time and distance. The direct proportionality shows a linear correlation that can be represented by a straight line. In fact, with this relationship, we can predict exactly how long it will take to travel a certain distance, or how much distance can be covered given a time constraint.

In any linear behavior, we expect something constant, much like the slope in a linear equation \( y = mx + b \). Instead of the slope (as \( \Delta y / \Delta x \)), we use the concept of constant velocity. Maintaining this constant allows us to project a path along a line, which is exactly what Newton described in his First Law of Motion. 

However, there are specific conditions under which this law holds true. Let’s dissect the parameters of the First Law and apply our basic understanding of proportionality to grasp the relationships in the law of inertia.
