# Divisibility Rules - 10s

Here are some clever rules of divisibility specifically for numbers based on powers of 10 (like 10, 100, 1000, etc.):

### **Rules of Divisibility for 10s-Based Numbers**

1. **Divisibility by 10**:
>- A number is divisible by 10 if its last digit is 0.

2. **Divisibility by 100**:
>- A number is divisible by 100 if its last two digits are 00.

3. **Divisibility by 1000**:
>- A number is divisible by 1000 if its last three digits are 000.

4. **Divisibility by 10,000**:
>- A number is divisible by 10,000 if its last four digits are 0000.

5. **Divisibility by 10^n** (where \( n \) is any positive integer):
>- A number is divisible by \( 10^n \) if its last \( n \) digits are all zeros.

### **Patterns and Tricks for 10s-Based Divisibility**

1. **Divisibility by 20**:
>- A number is divisible by 20 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 20.

2. **Divisibility by 200**:
>- A number is divisible by 200 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 200.

3. **Divisibility by 2000**:
>- A number is divisible by 2000 if its last four digits form a number divisible by 2000.

4. **Divisibility by 50**:
>- A number is divisible by 50 if its last digit is 0 and the second last digit is either 0 or 5.

5. **Divisibility by 500**:
>- A number is divisible by 500 if its last three digits are 000, and the digits immediately before the last three are divisible by 5.

### **General Tips for 10s-Based Divisibility**

1. **Multiples of Powers of 10**:
>- For any multiple of \( 10^n \), check that the last \( n \) digits of the number are zeros.

2. **Combination of 10s-Based Divisibility**:
>- For numbers like 30, 40, 60, etc., you can use a combination of the basic rules. For example, a number is divisible by 30 if it is divisible by both 10 and 3. Similarly, check the divisibility for multiples of 40 by confirming divisibility by 10 and 4.

### **Examples**

1. **Example for Divisibility by 1000**:
>- To check if 123,000 is divisible by 1000, look at the last three digits: 000. Since they are all zeros, 123,000 is divisible by 1000.

2. **Example for Divisibility by 200**:
>- To check if 45,800 is divisible by 200, check the last three digits: 800. Since 800 is divisible by 200, 45,800 is divisible by 200.

3. **Example for Divisibility by 500**:
>- To check if 123,500 is divisible by 500, check the last three digits: 500. Since 500 is divisible by 500, 123,500 is divisible by 500.

### **Summary**

The rules for divisibility by numbers based on powers of 10 are straightforward and involve looking at the number of trailing zeros in a number. For other numbers that are multiples of 10, you combine the basic divisibility rules of their factors. These rules help simplify checking divisibility and solving problems involving large numbers.
