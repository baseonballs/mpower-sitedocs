# Count Number of Factors of $N$

Counting the number of factors of an integer can be efficiently done using properties from number theory, particularly by leveraging the prime factorization of the integer. Here’s a detailed guide on how to count the number of factors using number theory:

## **Prime Factorization Method**

1. **Find the Prime Factorization:**

   Express the integer \( n \) as a product of prime factors. Suppose:

\[
n = p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}
   \]

   where \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k \) are distinct prime numbers, and \( e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_k \) are their respective exponents.

2. **Apply the Formula to Count Factors:**

   The total number of factors of \( n \) is given by:

\[
\text{number of factors} = (e_1 + 1) \cdot (e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1)
\]

   Each exponent \( e_i \) is incremented by 1 because the factors include all powers from 0 up to \( e_i \).

## **Example Calculation**

Let’s go through an example to illustrate this process:

**Example 1: Count the factors of \( n = 60 \)**

1. **Find the Prime Factorization of 60:**

\[
60 = 2^2 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^1
\]

   Here, \( 2 \), \( 3 \), and \( 5 \) are the primes, with exponents \( 2 \), \( 1 \), and \( 1 \) respectively.

2. **Apply the Formula:**

\[
\text{number of factors} = (2 + 1) \cdot (1 + 1) \cdot (1 + 1)
\]

   Simplify:

\[
\text{number of factors} = 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 12
\]

   Therefore, 60 has 12 factors.

**Example 2: Count the factors of \( n = 72 \)**

1. **Find the Prime Factorization of 72:**

\[
72 = 2^3 \cdot 3^2
\]

   Here, \( 2 \) and \( 3 \) are the primes, with exponents \( 3 \) and \( 2 \) respectively.

2. **Apply the Formula:**

\[
\text{N=number of factors} = (3 + 1) \cdot (2 + 1)
\]

   Simplify:

\[
\text{number of factors} = 4 \cdot 3 = 12
\]

   Therefore, 72 also has 12 factors.

## **General Approach Using Number Theory**

1. **Factorization**: Break down the number into its prime factors.
2. **Exponent Handling**: For each distinct prime factor, use its exponent in the formula.
3. **Multiply**: Multiply the results obtained from each factor.

### **Additional Considerations**

- **For Perfect Squares**: If \( n \) is a perfect square, the factor count will be symmetric. For instance, \( n = 36 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \), which has \( (2 + 1) \cdot (2 + 1) = 9 \) factors.

- **For Special Cases**: Use divisors counting formulas for numbers with more complex factorizations or properties (e.g., highly composite numbers, factorials).

## **Summary**

Counting the number of factors of an integer involves prime factorization and applying a straightforward formula based on the exponents of these prime factors. This method is efficient and widely used in number theory to understand the properties and divisors of integers.
