# Strategies for Solving Problem Solving

When tackling a mathematical question or problem, having a set of thinking tools or strategies can be really helpful. Here are some common and effective ones:

## 1. **Understand the Problem**

   - **Read Carefully**: Make sure you understand what is being asked. Identify the key information and what you need to find.
   - **Restate the Problem**: Put the problem in your own words to ensure clarity. In fact, get in the hatbit of reading the problem statemewnt at least 3 times.

## 2. **Break It Down - Deconstruct**

   - **Decompose**: Divide the problem into smaller, more manageable parts. Solve each part separately if possible.
   - **Simplify**: Look for ways to simplify the problem, such as approximating or ignoring non-essential details.

## 3. **Draw a Diagram**

   - **Visualize**: Sometimes drawing a picture or diagram can help make the problem clearer and highlight relationships between different parts.

## 4. **Look for Patterns**

   - **Identify Patterns**: Look for repeating patterns or structures within the problem that could simplify solving it.
   - **Generalize**: See if you can generalize the problem to a broader context or apply known patterns.

## 5. **Use Logical Reasoning**

   - **Deductive Reasoning**: Use known facts and logical steps to arrive at a conclusion.
   - **Inductive Reasoning**: Use specific examples to identify a general rule or pattern.
   - **Apply Number Sense**: Review the answer or solution; does it seem reawsonable and logical.

## 6. **Apply Mathematical Techniques**

   - **Formulas**: Use relevant mathematical formulas or equations.
   - **Algebraic Manipulation**: Rearrange and simplify equations or expressions.
   - **Calculus Tools**: Apply differentiation or integration if the problem involves calculus.

## 7. **Work Backwards**

   - **Reverse Engineer**: Start from the desired solution and work backwards to see if you can arrive at the original problem.

## 8. **Check for Special Cases**

   - **Test Extremes**: Try extreme values or special cases to see if they provide insight or help in understanding the problem.

## 9. **Use Estimation**

   - **Approximate**: Make reasonable approximations to check if they align with the expected results.

## 10. **Review and Reflect**

   - **Verify**: Double-check your solution by substituting it back into the original problem or using a different method.
   - **Reflect**: Think about what worked well and what didnâ€™t. Understanding your process can help in future problems.

## 11. **Seek Patterns in Solutions**

   - **Compare Solutions**: Look at similar problems or previous examples to see if there are common strategies that can be applied.

## 12. **Collaborate**

   - **Discuss with Others**: Sometimes talking through the problem with someone else can provide new perspectives or solutions.

Using these tools can help you approach mathematical problems more systematically and effectively.
