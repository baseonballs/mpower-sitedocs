>**Critical Thinking Framework** - Word of Advise
>
>When problem-solving, remember to apply the tools from your critical thinking framework. Problem-solving requires deliberate mental effort to maximize a successful outcome. You must persist, even if the result isn't what you expected or seems negative. Remember, it’s not about getting the “right” answer; it's more about the process you followed and how you rationalized your way to the end. Solving math problems is a reasoning skill.

>To improve your chances of success, follow these steps:

>- **Read the problem statement carefully.** Make it a habit to read it 2-3 times, even if you think you understand it.
- **Deconstruct the problem**, arguably the most important phase of analysis. Identify the key components:
  1. Identify the **Givens**, **Unknowns**, **Constraints**, and/or **Conditions**.
  2. Break the problem into smaller parts and use a divide-and-conquer strategy.
- **Apply inference** — draw connections between the data and information you’ve collected or concluded.
