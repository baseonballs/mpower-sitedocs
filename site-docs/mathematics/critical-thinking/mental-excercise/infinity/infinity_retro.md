# Infinity

When discussing infinity between two whole numbers, it's important to understand that infinity is not a number but a concept describing something that goes on without end. However, we can explore the idea of infinitely many numbers between two whole numbers.

### Key Points

1. **Density of Rational Numbers**: Between any two distinct whole numbers, such as 1 and 2, there are infinitely many rational numbers. For instance, numbers like \(1.1, 1.01, 1.001\), and so on, can be found between 1 and 2. In fact, you can always find more fractions between any two given fractions, demonstrating that there are infinitely many rational numbers in any interval.

2. **Real Numbers**: The same idea applies to real numbers. Between any two whole numbers, there are not just infinitely many rational numbers but also infinitely many real numbers. For example, between 1 and 2, you can find numbers like \(\sqrt{1.5}\), \(1.5\), and \(\pi - 1\), among countless others.

3. **No Smallest Positive Distance**: There is no smallest positive distance between two numbers because no matter how close you get to one of the numbers, you can always find another number closer. This is true for any interval on the real number line.

### Examples

- **Between 1 and 2**: Consider the interval [1, 2]. The numbers 1.5, 1.75, 1.875, and so on, fill this interval without end. If you take any two numbers in this interval, no matter how close they are, there are still infinitely many numbers between them.

- **Between 3 and 4**: Similarly, the interval [3, 4] contains infinitely many numbers such as 3.1, 3.01, 3.001, and so forth. This idea can be applied to any two distinct whole numbers.

### Visualization

To visualize this concept, think of a number line where the interval between any two whole numbers is densely packed with an infinite number of points. Even though you can't physically list all the numbers, you can conceptually understand that there are infinitely many numbers in between.

In summary, the concept of infinity between two whole numbers highlights the idea that between any two points on the number line, there are infinitely many other points, reflecting the continuous and unbounded nature of the real number system.
