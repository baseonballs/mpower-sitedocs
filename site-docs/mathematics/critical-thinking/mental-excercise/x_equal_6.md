# Mental Excercise: - Variable Assignment

## Problem Statement

You are presented with this information on a clean whiteboard: 

\[
x = 6
\]

## Reflection

Apply your critical thinking skills. What comes to mind when you encounter this question? It's rather open-ended, allowing you to interpret it and provide an answer that reflects your own reasoning.  A simple resposne would be:

> x is avariable that assigned a value of 6.

Yes, that's true and obvious, but by asking more questions and digging deeper, you'd be surprised at what you can discover. By broadening the range of questions to the person posing the problem or question, you'll often uncover implied constraints or realize that there are no constraints at all.
