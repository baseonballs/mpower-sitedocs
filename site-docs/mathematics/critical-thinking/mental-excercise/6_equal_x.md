# Mental Excercise: - Number Assignment

## Problem Statement

You are presented with this math statement:

\[
6 = x
\]

## Reflection

Apply your critical thinking skills. What comes to mind when you encounter this question? It's rather open-ended, allowing you to interpret it and provide an answer that reflects your own reasoning.

> In algebra, the syntax is valid since RHS = LHS; by the community axiom of algebra LHS = RHS; which mean x = 6 is the same as 6 = x.  In computer programing this would not make sense. A constant cannot be assigned avalue. It is immutable.
