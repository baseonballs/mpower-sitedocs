# Fibonaci Numbers

The Fibonacci sequence is a famous mathematical series named after Leonardo of Pisa, who is also known as Fibonacci. It is defined recursively with the following properties:

1. **Initial Conditions**: The first two terms are typically defined as 0 and 1 (though sometimes the sequence starts with 1 and 1).
2. **Recursive Definition**: Each subsequent term is the sum of the two preceding terms.

Mathematically, the sequence can be expressed as:
- \( F(0) = 0 \)
- \( F(1) = 1 \)
- \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \) for \( n \geq 2 \)

So, the sequence begins as: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.

### Properties and Applications:

1. **Golden Ratio**: As the Fibonacci sequence progresses, the ratio of successive Fibonacci numbers (i.e., \( \frac{F(n+1)}{F(n)} \)) approximates the Golden Ratio, approximately 1.618. This ratio is often found in nature, art, and architecture.

2. **Nature**: Fibonacci numbers appear in various natural phenomena, such as the arrangement of leaves, the branching of trees, the arrangement of a pine cone, and the pattern of a sunflower.

3. **Mathematics**: The sequence has a variety of interesting mathematical properties. For instance, every positive integer can be uniquely represented as a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers (this is known as Zeckendorf's theorem).

4. **Computer Science**: Fibonacci numbers are used in algorithms and data structures, such as in the Fibonacci heap data structure and certain recursive algorithms. The sequence also has connections to the computational complexity of algorithms.

5. **Art and Architecture**: The Fibonacci sequence and the related Golden Ratio have been used in art and architecture to create aesthetically pleasing proportions.

6. **Financial Markets**: Some traders use Fibonacci retracement levels to predict potential support and resistance levels in financial markets.

The Fibonacci sequence is a rich area of study with connections to many different fields, reflecting both its mathematical beauty and practical applications.
