# Patterns in Numbers

Patterns in numbers are fascinating because they often reveal underlying structures and relationships in mathematics. Here are a few interesting patterns:

1. **Fibonacci Sequence and Nature**: The Fibonacci sequence (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...) is a famous pattern where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. This sequence appears in nature, like in the arrangement of leaves, the branching of trees, and the spiral patterns of shells.

2. **Magic Squares**: A magic square is a grid of numbers where every row, column, and diagonal adds up to the same sum. Magic squares have been studied for thousands of years and are found in different cultures, like in ancient Chinese and Indian mathematics.

3. **Triangular Numbers**: Triangular numbers are numbers that can form an equilateral triangle. For instance, the first few triangular numbers are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15... They are found by adding consecutive integers: 1, 1+2=3, 1+2+3=6, and so on.

4. **Pascal's Triangle**: Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. This pattern appears in algebra, combinatorics, and even probability theory. The numbers in Pascal's Triangle correspond to the coefficients in binomial expansions, as well as to Fibonacci numbers along its diagonals.

5. **Prime Number Gaps**: While prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11...) seem irregular at first, mathematicians have discovered patterns in the gaps between them. Although the primes themselves don't follow a clear formula, the distribution of these gaps reveals deep insights about number theory.
