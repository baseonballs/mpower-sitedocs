# CheatSheet - Geometry Theorems

### 1. **Pythagorean Theorem**

- **Statement**: In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\]

  where \( a \) and \( b \) are the legs, and \( c \) is the hypotenuse.

### 2. **Triangle Sum Theorem**
- **Statement**: The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always \(180^\circ\).

\[
\angle A + \angle B + \angle C = 180^\circ
\]

### 3. **Exterior Angle Theorem**
- **Statement**: The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.

\[
\text{Exterior Angle} = \angle A + \angle B
\]

### 4. **Isosceles Triangle Theorem**
- **Statement**: In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are congruent.

\[
\text{If } AB = AC, \text{ then } \angle B = \angle C
\]

### 5. **Midpoint Theorem**
- **Statement**: The segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.

\[
\text{If } D \text{ and } E \text{ are midpoints of sides of triangle ABC, then } DE \parallel BC \text{ and } DE = \frac{1}{2}BC
\]

### 6. **Similar Triangles Theorem**
- **Statement**: If two triangles have corresponding angles equal, then their corresponding sides are proportional, and the triangles are similar.

\[
\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF \implies \frac{AB}{DE} = \frac{BC}{EF} = \frac{CA}{FD}
\]

### 7. **Alternate Interior Angles Theorem**
- **Statement**: If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, the alternate interior angles are congruent.

\[
\angle 1 = \angle 2 \quad (\text{if lines are parallel})
\]

### 8. **Angle Bisector Theorem**
- **Statement**: The angle bisector of a triangle divides the opposite side into two segments that are proportional to the other two sides.

\[
\frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{BD}{DC}
\]

  where \( AD \) is the bisector.

### 9. **Congruence Theorems (Triangles)**
- **SSS (Side-Side-Side)**: If three sides of one triangle are congruent to three sides of another triangle, the triangles are congruent.

\[
\triangle ABC \cong \triangle DEF
\]
  
- **SAS (Side-Angle-Side)**: If two sides and the included angle of one triangle are congruent to two sides and the included angle of another triangle, the triangles are congruent.
  
- **ASA (Angle-Side-Angle)**: If two angles and the included side of one triangle are congruent to two angles and the included side of another triangle, the triangles are congruent.

### 10. **Circle Theorems**
- **Central Angle Theorem**: The measure of the central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.

\[
\text{Central Angle} = \text{Arc Measure}
\]
  
- **Inscribed Angle Theorem**: The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

\[
\text{Inscribed Angle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Arc Measure}
\]
  
- **Tangent-Secant Theorem**: If a tangent and a secant (or chord) meet at a point on a circle, the square of the tangent is equal to the product of the secant and its external part.

\[
\text{Tangent}^2 = \text{External Part} \times \text{Whole Secant}
\]

- **Chord-Chord Theorem**: If two chords intersect inside a circle, the products of the lengths of the segments of each chord are equal.

\[
AB \times BC = DE \times EF
\]

### 11. **Area and Volume Theorems**
- **Heronâ€™s Formula** (Area of a Triangle):

\[
A = \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}
\]

  where \( s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \) is the semi-perimeter, and \( a, b, c \) are the sides of the triangle.

- **Area of a Regular Polygon**:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Perimeter} \times \text{Apothem}
\]

### 12. **Parallelogram Theorems**
- **Opposite Sides Theorem**: The opposite sides of a parallelogram are congruent.

\[
AB = CD \quad \text{and} \quad AD = BC
\]

- **Diagonals Theorem**: The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.

\[
AE = EC \quad \text{and} \quad BE = ED
\]

### 13. **Tangent to a Circle**

- **Statement**: A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.

\[
\angle O = 90^\circ
\]
