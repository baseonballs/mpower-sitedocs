# **Elementary Graphing Problems**

## Method of Graphing the Quadratics

For each problem, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Function:**
   Write down the quadratic function in the form \(f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\).

2. **Determine Key Points:**
   - **Vertex:** Use the vertex formula \(x = -\frac{b}{2a}\) to find the x-coordinate of the vertex. Substitute this value back into the function to find the y-coordinate.
   - **Y-Intercept:** Set \(x = 0\) and solve for \(f(0)\) to find the y-intercept.

3. **Plot Points:**
   Plot the vertex and the y-intercept on the graph. Find additional points by substituting values of \(x\) into the function if needed.

4. **Find the Roots (x-intercepts):**
   - **Graph the Function:** Plot the quadratic function based on the points calculated and the shape of the parabola.
   - **Identify the x-Intercepts:** The x-intercepts are where the graph crosses the x-axis (where \(f(x) = 0\)).

5. **Draw the Parabola:**
   Sketch the curve of the parabola based on the plotted points and the vertex.

By graphing the quadratic functions and locating the x-intercepts, you can visually understand how quadratic equations can be solved using their graphical representations.
