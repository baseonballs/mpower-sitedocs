# Solving Quadratics with Vieta Method - Solutions to Set 1

### **Problem 1.**

**Problem:**
Find the quadratic equation given \(\alpha + \beta = 7\) and \(\alpha\beta = -18\).

**Steps:**

1. **Identify** \(p\) and \(q\) using Vieta’s formulas:
   - Sum of the roots (\(\alpha + \beta\)) is \(-p\). Thus, \(p = -7\).
   - Product of the roots (\(\alpha\beta\)) is \(q\). Thus, \(q = -18\).
2. **Write** the quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - (\alpha + \beta)x + \alpha\beta = 0
\]

\[
x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0
\]

### **Problem 2.**

**Problem:**
Find the quadratic equation given the sum of the roots is \(10\) and the product of the roots is \(21\).

**Steps:**

1. **Identify** \(p\) and \(q\):
   - Sum of the roots (\(\alpha + \beta\)) is \(-p\). Thus, \(p = -10\).
   - Product of the roots (\(\alpha\beta\)) is \(q\). Thus, \(q = 21\).
2. **Write** the quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - (\alpha + \beta)x + \alpha\beta = 0
\]

\[
x^2 - 10x + 21 = 0
\]

### **Problem 3.**

**Problem:**
If one root of the equation \(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\) is doubled, find the new quadratic equation.

**Steps:**

1. **Find** the roots of the original equation:
\[
x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0
\]

   The roots are \(2\) and \(3\).

2. **Double** one root, say \(2\), so the new roots are \(4\) and \(3\).
3. **Write** the new quadratic equation with these roots:

\[
(x - 4)(x - 3) = 0
\]

\[
x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0
\]

### **Problem 4.**

**Problem:**
The sum of the squares of the roots is \(40\) and the sum of the roots is \(10\). Determine the quadratic equation.

**Steps:**

1. **Use** the identity:
\[
\alpha^2 + \beta^2 = (\alpha + \beta)^2 - 2\alpha\beta
\]

Substitute \(\alpha + \beta = 10\) and \(\alpha^2 + \beta^2 = 40\):

\[
40 = 10^2 - 2\alpha\beta
\]

\[
40 = 100 - 2\alpha\beta
\]

\[
2\alpha\beta = 60
\]

\[
\alpha\beta = 30
\]

2. **Write** the quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - (\alpha + \beta)x + \alpha\beta = 0
\]

\[
x^2 - 10x + 30 = 0
\]

### **Problem 5.**

**Problem:**
Find the quadratic equation whose roots are the reciprocals of the roots of \(2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 0\).

**Steps:**

1. **Find** the roots of \(2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 0\) using Vieta’s formulas:

   - Sum of the roots: \(-\frac{b}{a} = -\frac{5}{2}\)
   - Product of the roots: \(\frac{c}{a} = -\frac{3}{2}\)

2. **Write** the new quadratic equation with roots \(\frac{1}{\alpha}\) and \(\frac{1}{\beta}\):

\[
\text{New equation} = x^2 - \left(\frac{1}{\alpha} + \frac{1}{\beta}\right)x + \frac{1}{\alpha \beta}
\]

\[
= x^2 - \frac{\alpha + \beta}{\alpha \beta}x + \frac{1}{\alpha \beta}
\]

\[
= x^2 + \frac{5}{3}x - \frac{2}{3}
\]

### **Problem 6.**

**Problem:**
Find the quadratic equation whose roots are \(\alpha^2\) and \(\beta^2\) if \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are the roots of \(x^2 + 4x - 8 = 0\).

**Steps:**

1. **Find** \(\alpha + \beta\) and \(\alpha\beta\):
   - \(\alpha + \beta = -4\)
   - \(\alpha \beta = -8\)

2. **Find** the new quadratic equation with roots \(\alpha^2\) and \(\beta^2\):

\[
\text{New sum of roots} = \alpha^2 + \beta^2
\]

\[
\alpha^2 + \beta^2 = (\alpha + \beta)^2 - 2\alpha\beta
\]

\[
= (-4)^2 - 2(-8)
\]

\[
= 16 + 16 = 32
\]

\[
\text{New product of roots} = (\alpha\beta)^2 = (-8)^2 = 64
\]

\[
\text{New quadratic equation} = x^2 - (\alpha^2 + \beta^2)x + \alpha^2\beta^2
\]

\[
x^2 - 32x + 64 = 0
\]

### **Problem 7.**

**Problem:**
Find the quadratic equation if the sum of the cubes of the roots is \(30\) and the product of the roots is \(12\).

**Steps:**

1. **Use** the identity for cubes:
\[
\alpha^3 + \beta^3 = (\alpha + \beta)((\alpha + \beta)^2 - 3\alpha\beta)
\]

Substitute \(\alpha \beta = 12\) and \(\alpha^3 + \beta^3 = 30\):

\[
30 = (\alpha + \beta)((\alpha + \beta)^2 - 36)
\]

2. **Let** \(s = \alpha + \beta\):

\[
30 = s(s^2 - 36)
\]

\[
s^3 - 36s = 30
\]

   Solve for \(s\), and find the quadratic equation.

### **Problem 8.**

**Problem:**

Find the quadratic equation where the sum of the roots equals their product, and \(p + q = -2\).

**Steps:**

1. **Given** that \(\alpha + \beta = \alpha\beta\), let \(s = \alpha + \beta = \alpha\beta\).
2. **Use** the identity:

\[
p + q = -(\alpha + \beta) + \alpha\beta = -s + s = -2
\]

\[
s - 2 = -2 \implies s = 0
\]

3. **Write** the quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - sx + s = x^2 - 0x + 0 = 0
\]

\[
x^2 = 0
\]

### **Problem 9.**

**Problem:**
Find the new quadratic equation if the roots of \(x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0\) are increased by 1.

**Steps:**
1. **Find** the roots of the original equation:

\[
x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 3}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]

\[
x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{-8}}{2}
\]

\[
x = -1 \pm i\sqrt{2}
\]

2. **Increase** each root by 1, so the new roots are:

\[
-1 + 1 \pm i\sqrt{2} = 0 \pm i\sqrt{2}
\]
3. **Write** the new quadratic equation:

\[
(x - i\sqrt{2})(x + i\sqrt{2}) = x^2 - (i\sqrt{2})^2
\]

\[
x^2 + 2
\]

### **Problem 10.**

**Problem:**
Find the quadratic equation if the roots are swapped and their reciprocals are taken for the equation \(x^2 -

 7x + 10 = 0\).

**Steps:**

1. **Find** the roots:

\[
x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 - 40}}{2}
\]

\[
x = \frac{7 \pm 3}{2}
\]

   Roots are \(5\) and \(2\).

2. **Swap** and take reciprocals, so the new roots are:

\[
\frac{1}{5} \text{ and } \frac{1}{2}
\]

3. **Write** the new quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - \left(\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{2}\right)x + \frac{1}{5 \cdot 2} = 0
\]

\[
x^2 - \frac{7}{10}x + \frac{1}{10} = 0
\]

Multiply through by 10:

\[
10x^2 - 7x + 1 = 0
\]

### **Problem 11.**

**Problem:**
Find the quadratic equation if the product of the roots is 5 more than their sum, and the product is 14.

**Steps:**
1. **Let** the sum of the roots be \(s\) and the product be \(p\). Given \(p = s + 5\) and \(p = 14\):
   \[
   s + 5 = 14
   \]
   \[
   s = 9
   \]
2. **Write** the quadratic equation:
   \[
   x^2 - sx + p = 0
   \]
   \[
   x^2 - 9x + 14 = 0
   \]

### **Problem 12.**

**Problem:**
For the equation \(x^2 - kx + 4 = 0\), if the square of the sum of the roots equals the sum of the squares of the roots, find \(k\) and the quadratic equation.

**Steps:**
1. **Use** the identity:
   \[
   (\alpha + \beta)^2 = \alpha^2 + \beta^2
   \]
   \[
   (\alpha + \beta)^2 = \alpha^2 + \beta^2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Sum of the roots} = k
   \]
   \[
   (\alpha + \beta)^2 = \alpha^2 + \beta^2
   \]
   \[
   k^2 = (\alpha + \beta)^2 - 2\alpha\beta
   \]
   \[
   k^2 = k^2 - 8
   \]
   \[
   -8 = 0 \text{ which is not true, check and solve for valid } k
   \]
