# Problem Set: Vieta Application of Quadratics

>“**Mathematics is the language in which the universe is written,**” Galileo once said. These problems challenge you to not only solve but also to interpret the deep relationships between the roots and coefficients of quadratic equations—a vital aspect of higher-level problem-solving.

Here are some challenging problem sets based on **Vieta's formulas**, designed to test your understanding of the relationships between the roots and coefficients of quadratic equations:

### **Problem Set: Vieta’s Formulas**

#### **Problem 1.**
The roots of the quadratic equation \(x^2 + px + q = 0\) are \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\). If \(\alpha + \beta = 7\) and \(\alpha\beta = -18\), find the quadratic equation.

#### **Problem 2.**
Given that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation is \(10\) and the product of the roots is \(21\), find the quadratic equation.

#### **Problem 3.**
If one root of the equation \(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\) is doubled, find the new quadratic equation with the modified root.

#### **Problem 4.**
The sum of the squares of the roots of the quadratic equation is \(40\) and the sum of the roots is \(10\). Determine the quadratic equation.

#### **Problem 5.**
Find the quadratic equation whose roots are the reciprocals of the roots of the equation \(2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 0\).

#### **Problem 6.**

#### **Problem 9.**

#### **Problem 11.**
The roots of the quadratic equation are such that their product is 5 more than their sum. Find the quadratic equation if the product of the roots is 14.

#### **Problem 12.**
For the equation \(x^2 - kx + 4 = 0\), if the square of the sum of the roots is equal to the sum of the squares of the roots, find the value of \(k\) and the corresponding quadratic equation.

### **Solutions Hints:**

#### **Problem 1.**
Use Vieta’s formulas:

\[
\alpha + \beta = -p, \quad \alpha\beta = q
\]

So, the equation is:

\[
x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0
\]

#### **Problem 2.**

Using the sum and product of the roots, the equation is:

\[
x^2 - 10x + 21 = 0
\]

#### **Problem 3.**
Let the roots of the original equation be \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), where \(\alpha + \beta = 5\) and \(\alpha\beta = 6\). If one root is doubled, say \(\alpha = 2\alpha\), the new sum of the roots becomes \((2\alpha + \beta)\) and the new product is \((2\alpha \beta)\).

#### **Problem 4.**
Use the identity:

\[
\alpha^2 + \beta^2 = (\alpha + \beta)^2 - 2\alpha\beta
\]

Solve for the coefficients and find the equation.

#### **Problem 5.**
For reciprocal roots, the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 5x + 2 = 0
\]

#### **Problem 6.**
For squared roots, use the identities:

\[
\alpha^2 + \beta^2 = (\alpha + \beta)^2 - 2\alpha\beta
\quad \text{and} \quad \alpha^2\beta^2 = (\alpha\beta)^2
\]

Solve to get the new quadratic equation.

#### **Problem 7.**
Use the identities involving sums of cubes:

\[
\alpha^3 + \beta^3 = (\alpha + \beta)((\alpha + \beta)^2 - 3\alpha\beta)
\]

Solve for the coefficients.

#### **Problem 8.**

Given \(\alpha + \beta = \alpha\beta\), use Vieta's formulas and the condition \(p + q = -2\) to find the equation.

#### **Problem 9.**

Let the roots be \(\alpha + 1\) and \(\beta + 1\). Use Vieta’s formulas to find the new equation.

#### **Problem 10.**

For reciprocal and swapped roots, the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - \frac{7}{10}x + 1 = 0
\]

#### **Problem 11.**
Given \(\alpha\beta = 5 + (\alpha + \beta)\), solve for the equation.

#### **Problem 12.**
Use the identity for the sum of squares:

\[
(\alpha + \beta)^2 = \alpha^2 + \beta^2
\]

Solve for \(k\).
