# Quadratic Curves and Graphs

When the focus shifts to **quadratic forms**, the discussion moves beyond linear relationships to consider **parabolic curves**, which are the graphs of **quadratic functions**. Quadratic functions are a central topic in algebra and calculus due to their symmetrical properties, vertex-based behavior, and their appearance in a wide variety of real-world applications.

## 1. **The Equation of a Quadratic Function**

The standard form of a quadratic equation is:

\[
y = ax^2 + bx + c
\]

where:

- \( y \) is the dependent variable,
- \( x \) is the independent variable,
- \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are constants, with \( a \neq 0 \).

The graph of this equation is a **parabola**, a U-shaped curve that may open upwards or downwards, depending on the value of \( a \).

## 2. **Key Properties of Quadratic Graphs**

   - **Parabola Shape**: The quadratic function always produces a parabolic curve. The direction and shape of the parabola depend on the coefficient \( a \).
     - **If \( a > 0 \)**, the parabola opens upwards (like a U shape).
     - **If \( a < 0 \)**, the parabola opens downwards (like an upside-down U).
   
   - **Vertex**: The vertex of the parabola is the highest or lowest point on the graph, depending on whether the parabola opens downwards or upwards, respectively.
     - The vertex represents the **minimum value** of the function when \( a > 0 \) and the **maximum value** when \( a < 0 \).
     - The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \), and plugging this value into the quadratic equation gives the y-coordinate of the vertex.
   
   - **Axis of Symmetry**: The parabola is symmetric about a vertical line called the **axis of symmetry**. This line passes through the vertex and has the equation \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \).
   
   - **Intercepts**:

     - **Y-Intercept**: The y-intercept is the point where the parabola crosses the y-axis, which occurs when \( x = 0 \). In the standard quadratic equation \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), the y-intercept is \( c \).
     - **X-Intercepts**: The x-intercepts (also called **roots** or **zeros**) are the points where the parabola crosses the x-axis (i.e., where \( y = 0 \)). The x-intercepts can be found by solving the quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) using methods like factoring, completing the square, or applying the **quadratic formula**:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

   The number of x-intercepts depends on the **discriminant** \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \):

- If \( \Delta > 0 \), there are two distinct real roots (two x-intercepts).
- If \( \Delta = 0 \), there is one real root (the parabola touches the x-axis at a single point, called a **double root**).
- If \( \Delta < 0 \), there are no real roots (the parabola does not intersect the x-axis).

## 3. **Forms of the Quadratic Equation**
   - **Standard Form**: The most general form, \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), is useful for identifying the y-intercept and calculating the vertex and axis of symmetry.
   
   - **Vertex Form**: The quadratic equation can also be written in **vertex form**:

\[
y = a(x - h)^2 + k
\]

where \( (h, k) \) is the vertex of the parabola. This form is particularly useful for quickly identifying the vertex and understanding how transformations affect the graph.

   - The sign of \( a \) determines whether the parabola opens upwards or downwards.
   - \( (h, k) \) directly represents the location of the vertex, making it easier to graph the function.

   - **Factored Form**: Another form is the **factored form**:

\[
y = a(x - x_1)(x - x_2)
\]

where \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) are the x-intercepts. This form is useful for finding the roots of the quadratic function and graphing the points where the parabola crosses the x-axis.

## 4. **Graphing Quadratic Functions**

To graph a quadratic function:

   1. **Identify the vertex** using the formula \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \) for the x-coordinate, and substitute it back into the equation to find the y-coordinate.
   2. **Plot the y-intercept**, which is the constant \( c \).
   3. **Find the x-intercepts** by solving the quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) (if they exist).
   4. **Use the axis of symmetry** to reflect points across the parabola for a more accurate sketch.

The symmetry of the parabola makes it easy to graph once the vertex and intercepts are determined.

## 5. **Transformations of Quadratic Graphs**

Quadratic graphs can undergo transformations similar to those of linear graphs, but with different effects due to their curvature:

   - **Vertical Shifts**: Adding a constant \( k \) to the function, \( y = ax^2 + bx + c + k \), shifts the entire parabola up or down by \( k \) units without changing its shape.
   - **Horizontal Shifts**: Replacing \( x \) with \( (x - h) \) in the equation \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \) shifts the graph horizontally. If \( h > 0 \), the graph shifts to the right; if \( h < 0 \), it shifts to the left.
   - **Reflection**: Multiplying the equation by \( -1 \) (i.e., \( y = -ax^2 \)) reflects the parabola across the x-axis, changing the direction in which it opens.
   - **Stretching and Compression**: The value of \( a \) controls the width of the parabola. If \( |a| > 1 \), the parabola is **narrower** (steeper). If \( |a| < 1 \), the parabola is **wider** (flatter).

## 6. **Applications of Quadratic Graphs**

Quadratic functions model a wide variety of real-world phenomena, including:

   - **Projectile Motion**: The height of an object thrown into the air follows a parabolic path, making quadratic equations essential for understanding projectile motion in physics.
   - **Optics and Parabolas**: The reflective properties of parabolas are used in designing satellite dishes, car headlights, and telescopes. Light rays reflecting off a parabolic surface all converge at the focus.
   - **Economics**: In economics, quadratic functions are used to model revenue and cost functions, particularly when analyzing profit maximization and loss minimization.

## 7. **Solving Systems of Equations Involving Quadratics**

In systems where a quadratic equation is paired with another quadratic or linear equation, the solutions can be found graphically by plotting both equations and identifying the points of intersection:

   - **Quadratic and Linear System**: The intersection points between a parabola and a line represent the solutions. There may be zero, one, or two points of intersection, corresponding to no solution, one solution, or two solutions, respectively.
   - **Quadratic and Quadratic System**: The intersection of two parabolas can result in zero, one, two, or more points of intersection, depending on how the parabolas are positioned relative to each other.

## 8. **Advantages of Quadratic Graphs**

   - **Symmetry**: The axis of symmetry and vertex make quadratic graphs easy to analyze, especially when identifying the maximum or minimum values.
   - **Real-World Modeling**: Quadratic functions naturally arise in many physical and economic scenarios, making them highly applicable for practical problem-solving.
   - **Rich Behavior**: Unlike linear graphs, which represent constant rates of change, quadratic graphs can model accelerating or decelerating processes.

## Summary

Quadratic curves and graphs, characterized by their parabolic shape, represent a step beyond linear forms. With features such as the vertex, axis of symmetry, and intercepts, they provide powerful tools for modeling a wide range of real-world phenomena. Understanding how to manipulate and interpret quadratic equations is essential for fields ranging from physics to economics, making them a cornerstone of algebra and applied mathematics.
