# Quadratics

Quadratic equations are a central topic in algebra, with numerous applications in fields like physics, engineering, economics, and biology. They model parabolic relationships where variables exhibit non-linear behavior. The general structure of a quadratic equation is given as:

## 1. **Forms of Quadratics**

There are varying forms of quadratics. These include:

1. General Form
2. Standard Form
3. Factored Form
4. Vertex Form

### 1.1 General Form

\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \]

where:

- \( x \) is the unknown variable.
- \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are constants, with \( a \neq 0 \) (if \( a = 0 \), the equation becomes linear).
- \( ax^2 \) is the quadratic term, \( bx \) is the linear term, and \( c \) is the constant (or the y-intercept).

### 1.2 Standard Form

The standard form of a quadratic equation represents the geometric perspective and is written as:

\[
a(x - h)^2 + k = 0
\]

- \( h \) and \( k \) represent the coordinates of the vertex of the parabola defined by the quadratic function.
- This form is useful for graphing because it directly shows the vertex \((h, k)\) and makes it easier to analyze the properties of the parabola (like its direction of opening, maximum or minimum points, and symmetry).

#### Key Differences:
- **General form** emphasizes the individual coefficients \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), and is more useful for algebraic manipulation.
- **Standard form** emphasizes the geometric properties of the parabola, such as its vertex and shape.

### 1.3 Factored Form

The factored form reveals the roots (solutions) of the quadratic equation:

\[ y = a(x - r_1)(x - r_2) \]

where:

- \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \) are the roots of the equation, i.e., the values of \( x \) that satisfy \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).

This form is useful for solving quadratic equations when factoring is possible. It also reveals that the parabola crosses the x-axis at \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \).


### 1.4 Vertex Form

The vertex form of a quadratic equation emphasizes the geometric features of the parabola and is expressed as:

\[ y = a(x - h)^2 + k \]

where:

- \( (h, k) \) is the vertex of the parabola.
- \( a \) determines the direction and width of the parabola (if \( a > 0 \), the parabola opens upward; if \( a < 0 \), it opens downward).

This form is particularly helpful in graphing quadratics and identifying key features like the vertex and axis of symmetry.

## 2. **Methods of Solving Quadratic Equation**

Quadratic equations can be solved using several methods:

1. **Factoring**: This involves rewriting the equation in factored form. For example:

\[ x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0 \]

   The solutions are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \).

2. **Completing the Square**: This method transforms the quadratic into vertex form by adding and subtracting terms:

\[ x^2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)^2 \]

   This is helpful when factoring is not easy, and it leads directly to the vertex form.

3. **Quadratic Formula**: For any quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the solutions can be found using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

   This formula always works, even when factoring is not possible or the roots are complex.

4. **Graphing**: By plotting the quadratic function, the points where the graph intersects the x-axis represent the real roots of the equation.

## 3. Discriminant

The discriminant \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \) in the quadratic formula helps determine the nature of the solutions:

- If \( \Delta > 0 \), the equation has two distinct real roots.
- If \( \Delta = 0 \), the equation has one real root (the parabola touches the x-axis at one point).
- If \( \Delta < 0 \), the equation has two complex conjugate roots (the parabola does not intersect the x-axis).

## 4. Geometrical Interpretation

Quadratic equations correspond to parabolas when graphed. Key features include:

- **Vertex**: The point \( (h, k) \), where the parabola reaches its minimum or maximum value, depending on the sign of \( a \).
- **Axis of Symmetry**: A vertical line passing through the vertex, given by \( x = h \).
- **Roots**: The x-intercepts of the parabola, if they exist.

Each form of the quadratic equation serves different purposes depending on the problem at hand.
