# Clarifying Question - Coefficient of Linear Equations

>Specifically, if \( a, b, x \in \mathbb{R} \), and \( a \) is an coefficient of x, why can't the constant \( a \) be zero?

## Analysis of Constraint

In the context of the linear equation \( ax + b = 0 \):

1. **Coefficient \( a \neq 0 \)**:

    - For an equation to be linear, the coefficient \( a \) of the variable \( x \) must be non-zero. This ensures that the equation maintains its linearity and describes a line rather than reducing to a constant. If \( a = 0 \), the equation \( ax + b = 0 \) simplifies to \( b = 0 \), which is not a linear equation in \( x \) but rather a statement about the constant \( b \).

2. **Variable \( x \) can be zero**:

    - **When \( x = 0 \)**: Substituting \( x = 0 \) into the equation \( ax + b = 0 \) gives:

    \[
    a \cdot 0 + b = b
    \]

     This indicates that \( b \) is the value of the equation when \( x = 0 \). In the context of graphing, this value represents the y-intercept of the line. Specifically, the y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Therefore, when \( x = 0 \), the y-intercept is at \((0, b)\).

3. **General Form and Y-Intercept**:
    
    - The equation \( ax + b = 0 \) can be rewritten in the slope-intercept form \( y = mx + c \) by solving for \( y \):

    \[
    ax + b = 0 \implies y = -\frac{a}{1}x - b
    \]

     Here, the y-intercept is \( -b \), but since we are dealing with the equation in its general form, the point \((0, b)\) indicates where the line crosses the y-axis.

## Summary

- **Coefficient \( a \)**: Must be non-zero (\( a \neq 0 \)) to ensure the equation represents a line.
- **Variable \( x \)**: Can be zero. When \( x = 0 \), the equation simplifies to \( b \), indicating that \( b \) is the y-intercept. Thus, the y-intercept is at the point \((0, b)\).

This explanation clarifies how the y-intercept is determined from the linear equation and confirms that \( x \) can be zero, providing insight into the line's intersection with the y-axis.
