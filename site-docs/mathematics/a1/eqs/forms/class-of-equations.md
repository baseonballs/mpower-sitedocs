# Class of Equations

In algebra, **equations** are mathematical statements that assert the equality of two expressions. They are the foundation for solving problems involving unknown values. The **form and structure** of an algebraic equation depend on the types of operations, the variables involved, and the degree of the equation.

### 1. **Linear Equations**
Linear equations are the simplest form of algebraic equations and have the general form:

\[
ax + b = 0
\]

- **Form**: \( ax + b = 0 \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants, and \( x \) is the variable.
- **Degree**: The degree of the equation is 1 (the highest exponent of the variable is 1).
- **Graph**: Graphically, a linear equation represents a straight line.
- **Examples**: 
  - \( 2x + 3 = 0 \)
  - \( 5x - 7 = 10 \)

### 2. **Quadratic Equations**
Quadratic equations involve variables raised to the second power and have the form:

\[
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
\]

- **Form**: \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are constants, and \( x \) is the variable.
- **Degree**: The degree of the equation is 2 (the highest exponent of the variable is 2).
- **Graph**: The graph of a quadratic equation is a parabola.
- **Examples**: 
  - \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \)
  - \( 3x^2 + 7x + 2 = 0 \)

### 3. **Polynomial Equations**
Polynomial equations extend beyond quadratics, containing variables raised to higher powers:

\[
a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0 = 0
\]

- **Form**: A sum of terms with powers of the variable, where \( a_n \) are constants.
- **Degree**: The degree is determined by the highest power of \( x \).
- **Graph**: The graph of polynomial equations can have multiple curves or bends depending on the degree.
- **Examples**: 
  - \( x^3 - 2x^2 + x - 5 = 0 \) (Cubic)
  - \( 2x^4 + x^3 - x + 1 = 0 \) (Quartic)

### 4. **Rational Equations**

Rational equations involve ratios of polynomials and have the form:

\[
\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = 0
\]

- **Form**: \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = 0 \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials.
- **Graph**: Graphically, these equations can have vertical or horizontal asymptotes.
- **Example**: 
  - \( \frac{x^2 - 1}{x + 1} = 0 \)

### 5. **Radical Equations**

Radical equations contain variables inside a radical (usually a square root or higher):

\[
\sqrt{f(x)} = g(x)
\]

- **Form**: An equation where at least one term is under a radical.
- **Example**: 
  - \( \sqrt{x + 2} = x - 1 \)

### 6. **Exponential and Logarithmic Equations**

Exponential equations have the variable in the exponent, while logarithmic equations involve logarithms:

- **Exponential Form**: \( a^x = b \)
- **Logarithmic Form**: \( \log_b(x) = y \)
- **Examples**:
  - Exponential: \( 2^x = 8 \)
  - Logarithmic: \( \log_2(x) = 3 \)

### 7. **Systems of Equations**
A system of equations involves multiple equations that share variables:

\[
\begin{aligned}
  a_1x + b_1y &= c_1 \\
  a_2x + b_2y &= c_2
\end{aligned}
\]

- **Form**: Multiple linear or nonlinear equations.
- **Solutions**: Solutions are found where the equations intersect.
- **Example**: 
  - \( x + y = 5 \) and \( 2x - y = 3 \)

### 8. **Inequalities**

Inequalities are similar to equations but instead of equality, they involve relations such as \( <, >, \leq, \geq \):

\[
ax + b < 0
\]

- **Form**: An expression involving an inequality sign.
- **Graph**: Solutions are represented as ranges on a number line or regions in a plane.
- **Example**: 
  - \( 3x - 2 \leq 5 \)

### Summary
The forms and structures of algebraic equations range from simple linear forms to more complex polynomials, rational functions, and exponential equations. Each type of equation has its own methods of solution, visual representation, and applications in real-world problems.
