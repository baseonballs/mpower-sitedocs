# Simplification Techniqus. 

These are some basic techniques used on the core areas of mathematics.  Mastering these will serve you well in advanced math.

### Algebra 1 Simplification Techniques

#### 1. **Combining Like Terms**
   - **Concept**: Like terms are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power. Combining them helps simplify expressions.
   - **Example**: 
     - Given \(3x + 5x - 2 = 0\):
       - Combine \(3x\) and \(5x\) to get \(8x - 2 = 0\).
       - Further simplification gives \(8x = 2\), so \(x = \frac{1}{4}\).

#### 2. **Distributive Property**
   - **Concept**: The distributive property allows you to eliminate parentheses in expressions. It states that \(a(b + c) = ab + ac\).
   - **Example**: 
     - Simplify \(2(x + 3) - 4\):
       - Distribute: \(2x + 6 - 4\).
       - Combine like terms: \(2x + 2\).

#### 3. **Factoring**
   - **Concept**: Factoring involves rewriting an expression as a product of its factors. It is useful in solving equations and simplifying expressions.
   - **Example**: 
     - For \(x^2 - 9\), notice it's a difference of squares:
       - Factor: \(x^2 - 3^2 = (x - 3)(x + 3)\).
       - This helps in solving \(x^2 - 9 = 0\) by setting each factor to zero: \(x - 3 = 0\) or \(x + 3 = 0\) gives \(x = 3\) or \(x = -3\).

#### 4. **Order of Operations**
   - **Concept**: The order of operations is crucial in simplification to avoid errors. Follow PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).
   - **Example**: 
     - Simplify \(4 + 3 \times (2^2 - 1)\):
       - Start with parentheses: \(2^2 = 4\) â†’ \(4 + 3 \times (4 - 1)\).
       - Calculate inside parentheses: \(4 - 1 = 3\).
       - Continue: \(4 + 3 \times 3 = 4 + 9 = 13\).

### Algebra 2 Simplification Techniques

#### 1. **Rational Expressions**
   - **Concept**: Simplifying rational expressions involves factoring the numerator and denominator and canceling common factors.
   - **Example**: 
     - For \(\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}\):
       - Factor numerator: \(x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)\).
       - Simplify: \(\frac{(x - 1)(x + 1)}{x - 1}\) cancels to \(x + 1\) (note \(x \neq 1\)).

#### 2. **Exponential and Logarithmic Properties**
   - **Concept**: Properties of exponents and logarithms can simplify complex expressions.
   - **Example**: 
     - Simplify \(a^m \cdot a^n\):
       - Use \(a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\). If \(a = 2\), \(m = 3\), \(n = 2\):
       - \(2^3 \cdot 2^2 = 2^{3+2} = 2^5 = 32\).

#### 3. **Completing the Square**
   - **Concept**: Completing the square rewrites quadratic expressions into a vertex form, aiding in solving or graphing.
   - **Example**: 
     - For \(x^2 + 6x\), complete the square:
       - Take half of 6 (which is 3), square it to get 9.
       - Rewrite: \(x^2 + 6x = (x + 3)^2 - 9\).

#### 4. **Polynomial Long Division**
   - **Concept**: Useful for dividing polynomials, especially when simplifying rational functions.
   - **Example**: 
     - To divide \(x^3 + 2x^2 - 5\) by \(x + 1\):
       - Perform long division to get a quotient of \(x^2 + x - 6\) with a remainder.
