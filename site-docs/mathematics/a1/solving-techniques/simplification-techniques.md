# Simplification Techniqus. 

These are some basic techniques used on the core areas of mathematics.  Mastering these will serve you well in advanced math.

### Algebra 1 Simplification Techniques

#### 1. **Combining Like Terms**

- **Concept**: Like terms are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power. Combining them helps simplify expressions.
- **Example**: 
    - Given \(3x + 5x - 2 = 0\):
    - Combine \(3x\) and \(5x\) to get \(8x - 2 = 0\).
    - Further simplification gives \(8x = 2\), so \(x = \frac{1}{4}\).

#### 2. **Distributive Property**

- **Concept**: The distributive property allows you to eliminate parentheses in expressions. It states that \(a(b + c) = ab + ac\).
- **Example**: 
    - Simplify \(2(x + 3) - 4\):
    - Distribute: \(2x + 6 - 4\).
    - Combine like terms: \(2x + 2\).

#### 3. **Factoring**

- **Concept**: Factoring involves rewriting an expression as a product of its factors. It is useful in solving equations and simplifying expressions.
- **Example**: 
    - For \(x^2 - 9\), notice it's a difference of squares:
    - Factor: \(x^2 - 3^2 = (x - 3)(x + 3)\).
    - This helps in solving \(x^2 - 9 = 0\) by setting each factor to zero: \(x - 3 = 0\) or \(x + 3 = 0\) gives \(x = 3\) or \(x = -3\).

#### 4. **Order of Operations**

- **Concept**: The order of operations is crucial in simplification to avoid errors. Follow PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).
- **Example**: 
    - Simplify \(4 + 3 \times (2^2 - 1)\):
    - Start with parentheses: \(2^2 = 4\) â†’ \(4 + 3 \times (4 - 1)\).
    - Calculate inside parentheses: \(4 - 1 = 3\).
    - Continue: \(4 + 3 \times 3 = 4 + 9 = 13\).
