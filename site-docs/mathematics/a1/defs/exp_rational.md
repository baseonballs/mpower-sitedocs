# Rational Exponent

A **rational exponent** is an exponent that is a rational number, meaning it can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are integers and \(q \neq 0\). Rational exponents generalize the concept of integer exponents and are used to express both roots and powers of numbers.

## Key Points About Rational Exponents:

### 1. **Definition**:
  If \(a\) is a positive number and \(\frac{p}{q}\) is a rational number, then: \(a^{\frac{p}{q}} = \sqrt[q]{a^p}\)

  This means that \(a^{\frac{p}{q}}\) represents the \(q\)-th root of \(a^p\).

### 2. **Example**:
  For \(a = 27\) and \(\frac{2}{3}\) as a rational exponent: \(27^{\frac{2}{3}}\)

  This can be interpreted as:\(\sqrt[3]{27^2}\)

  First, calculate \(27^2\):\(27^2 = 729\)

  Then, take the cube root of 729:\(\sqrt[3]{729} = 9\)

  So:\(27^{\frac{2}{3}} = 9\)

### 3. **General Rules**:
   - **For positive \(a\) and rational \(\frac{p}{q}\)**:

\[
a^{\frac{p}{q}} = \left(a^{\frac{1}{q}}\right)^p
\]

   - **For negative exponents**:
  Rational exponents with negative exponents are expressed as:

\[
a^{-\frac{p}{q}} = \frac{1}{a^{\frac{p}{q}}}
\]

   - **Combining exponents**:
  Rational exponents follow the same laws as integer exponents:

\[
a^{\frac{p}{q} + \frac{r}{s}} = a^{\frac{ps + rq}{qs}}
\]

\[
(a^{\frac{p}{q}})^r = a^{\frac{pr}{q}}
\]

## Summary

Rational exponents provide a convenient way to handle fractional powers and roots using exponentiation. They extend the concept of exponents beyond integers, making it easier to work with roots and powers in algebraic expressions.
