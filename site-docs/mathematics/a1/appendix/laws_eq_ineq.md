# Laws of Equality and Inequality

The **laws of equality** and **laws of inequalities** are fundamental concepts in mathematics that underpin the manipulation and comparison of numbers and expressions. Understanding these laws is essential for solving equations, proving mathematical statements, and analyzing inequalities. Letâ€™s explore these laws in detail.

## **Laws of Equality**

The laws of equality are rules that govern how we can manipulate equations and maintain the equality of expressions. They ensure that any operations performed on both sides of an equation do not alter the truth of the equation. The key laws are:

### 1. **Reflexive Law of Equality**
- **Statement**: \(a = a\)
- **Description**: Every quantity is equal to itself. This is the simplest and most intuitive of the equality laws, asserting that any mathematical object is always equal to itself.

### 2. **Symmetric Law of Equality**
- **Statement**: If \(a = b\), then \(b = a\)
- **Description**: If one quantity equals a second quantity, then the second quantity equals the first. This law reflects the idea that equality is a two-way relationship.

#### 3. **Transitive Law of Equality**
- *Statement**: If \(a = b\) and \(b = c\), then \(a = c\)
- **Description**: If one quantity is equal to a second, and that second quantity is equal to a third, then the first quantity is equal to the third. This law establishes a chain of equality.

### 4. **Addition Property of Equality**
- **Statement**: If \(a = b\), then \(a + c = b + c\)
- **Description**: Adding the same quantity to both sides of an equation preserves equality. This property is used to simplify and solve equations.

### 5. **Subtraction Property of Equality**
- **Statement**: If \(a = b\), then \(a - c = b - c\)
- **Description**: Subtracting the same quantity from both sides of an equation preserves equality. It is another tool for solving equations.

### 6. **Multiplication Property of Equality**
- **Statement**: If \(a = b\), then \(a \times c = b \times c\)
- **Description**: Multiplying both sides of an equation by the same non-zero quantity maintains equality.

### 7. **Division Property of Equality**
- **Statement**: If \(a = b\) and \(c \neq 0\), then \(\frac{a}{c} = \frac{b}{c}\)
- **Description**: Dividing both sides of an equation by the same non-zero quantity preserves equality.

## **Laws of Inequalities**

The laws of inequalities are rules that help in comparing quantities and solving inequalities. They describe how to manipulate inequalities while preserving their truth. The key laws are:

### 1. **Reflexive Law of Inequality**
- **Statement**: \(a \leq a\) and \(a \geq a\)
- **Description**: Every quantity is less than or equal to itself, and greater than or equal to itself.

### 2. **Transitive Law of Inequality**
- **Statement**: If \(a \leq b\) and \(b \leq c\), then \(a \leq c\); and if \(a \geq b\) and \(b \geq c\), then \(a \geq c\)
- **Description**: If one quantity is less than or equal to a second, and that second quantity is less than or equal to a third, then the first quantity is less than or equal to the third. Similarly for greater than or equal.

#### 3. **Addition Property of Inequality**
-**Statement**: If \(a \leq b\), then \(a + c \leq b + c\); and if \(a \geq b\), then \(a + c \geq b + c\)
- **Description**: Adding the same quantity to both sides of an inequality preserves the inequality. The direction of the inequality remains unchanged.

### 4. **Subtraction Property of Inequality**
- **Statement**: If \(a \leq b\), then \(a - c \leq b - c\); and if \(a \geq b\), then \(a - c \geq b - c\)
- **Description**: Subtracting the same quantity from both sides of an inequality preserves the inequality. The direction of the inequality remains unchanged.

### 5. **Multiplication Property of Inequality (Positive Factor)**
- **Statement**: If \(a \leq b\) and \(c > 0\), then \(a \times c \leq b \times c\); and if \(a \geq b\) and \(c > 0\), then \(a \times c \geq b \times c\)
- **Description**: Multiplying both sides of an inequality by a positive number preserves the direction of the inequality.

### 6. **Multiplication Property of Inequality (Negative Factor)**
- **Statement**: If \(a \leq b\) and \(c < 0\), then \(a \times c \geq b \times c\); and if \(a \geq b\) and \(c < 0\), then \(a \times c \leq b \times c\)
- **Description**: Multiplying both sides of an inequality by a negative number reverses the direction of the inequality.

### 7. **Division Property of Inequality (Positive Divisor)**
- **Statement**: If \(a \leq b\) and \(c > 0\), then \(\frac{a}{c} \leq \frac{b}{c}\); and if \(a \geq b\) and \(c > 0\), then \(\frac{a}{c} \geq \frac{b}{c}\)
- **Description**: Dividing both sides of an inequality by a positive number preserves the direction of the inequality.

### 8. **Division Property of Inequality (Negative Divisor)**
- **Statement**: If \(a \leq b\) and \(c < 0\), then \(\frac{a}{c} \geq \frac{b}{c}\); and if \(a \geq b\) and \(c < 0\), then \(\frac{a}{c} \leq \frac{b}{c}\)
- **Description**: Dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative number reverses the direction of the inequality.
