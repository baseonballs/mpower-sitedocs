# Structure of Inequalities: Symbols and Notation

Inequalities are mathematical expressions similar to equations but, instead of asserting that two sides are equal, they indicate a relationship where one side is greater than or less than the other. Inequalities are commonly used in many areas of mathematics to describe ranges of values and are often crucial in fields like optimization, calculus, and number theory.

## **Basic Structure of Inequalities**

An inequality has a structure similar to that of an equation, except it uses inequality symbols instead of the equals sign. The general form of an inequality is:

\[
\text{LHS} \ \text{[inequality symbol]} \ \text{RHS}
\]

Where:

- **LHS** (Left-hand side): The expression or value on the left side of the inequality.
- **RHS** (Right-hand side): The expression or value on the right side.

The set of operators include:

The set of common inequality symbols can be represented in set notation as follows:

\[ \{ operator \mid operator \in \{ <, \leq, >, \geq \}; \text{ where LHS [operator] RHS } \} \]

Here's what each symbol represents:

- \( < \): Less than
- \( \leq \): Less than or equal to
- \( > \): Greater than
- \( \geq \): Greater than or equal to

## **Key Symbols in Inequalities**

1. **Inequality Symbols**:
      - **Less than ("<")**: The LHS is smaller than the RHS.
         - Example: \( x < 5 \)
      - **Greater than (">")**: The LHS is larger than the RHS.
         - Example: \( x > 3 \)
      - **Less than or equal to ("≤")**: The LHS is either smaller than or equal to the RHS.
         - Example: \( x \leq 10 \)
      - **Greater than or equal to ("≥")**: The LHS is either larger than or equal to the RHS.
         - Example: \( x \geq -2 \)

2. **Variables**:
      - Just like in equations, inequalities often include variables representing unknown quantities.
      - Example: \( 2x + 3 \geq 7 \)

3. **Constants**:
      - These are fixed numerical values.
      - Example: In the inequality \( x + 5 < 12 \), the constant is 5.

4. **Expressions**:
      - Both sides of an inequality can include algebraic expressions.
      - Example: \( 3x + 4 \leq 7x - 2 \)

5. **Set Notation**:
      - Solutions to inequalities are often expressed using set notation, interval notation, or on a number line.
      - Example: The solution to \( x > 2 \) can be expressed in interval notation as \( (2, \infty) \).

## **Solving Inequalities**

Solving inequalities follows similar rules to solving equations, but there is one critical difference: when multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the direction of the inequality sign must be reversed.

### **Examples:**
1. **Simple Inequality**:
      - \( 2x + 5 > 9 \)
      - Subtract 5 from both sides: \( 2x > 4 \)
      - Divide by 2: \( x > 2 \)

2. **Inequality with Multiplication by a Negative**:
      - \( -3x < 9 \)
      - Divide by -3, and reverse the inequality: \( x > -3 \)

---

## **Types of Inequalities**

1. **Linear Inequalities**:
      - Similar to linear equations but with inequality symbols. The highest power of the variable is 1.
         - Example: \( 3x - 4 \leq 7 \)
   
2. **Quadratic Inequalities**:
      - Involve quadratic expressions (where the variable is squared).
         - Example: \( x^2 - 3x \geq 4 \)

3. **Rational Inequalities**:
      - Involve ratios of polynomials.
         - Example: \( \frac{x + 1}{x - 2} \geq 0 \)

4. **Absolute Value Inequalities**:
      - Involve the absolute value function.
         - Example: \( |x - 3| \leq 7 \)

---

## **Mathematical Rules for Inequalities**

1. **Addition and Subtraction**:
      - Adding or subtracting the same number on both sides of an inequality does not change the direction of the inequality.
         - Example: \( x + 5 > 7 \) becomes \( x > 2 \) after subtracting 5 from both sides.

2. **Multiplication and Division**:
      - Multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a positive number does not change the inequality's direction.
      - Multiplying or dividing by a negative number **reverses** the inequality sign.
         - Example: \( -2x \leq 6 \) becomes \( x \geq -3 \) after dividing by -2.

3. **Transitive Property**:
      - If \( a > b \) and \( b > c \), then \( a > c \).
         - Example: If \( x > 3 \) and \( 3 > 1 \), then \( x > 1 \).

## **Representing Solutions of Inequalities**

1. **Number Line**:
      - Inequalities can be represented graphically on a number line.
         - Example: \( x > 2 \) is shown by an open circle at 2, with shading to the right indicating all numbers greater than 2.

2. **Interval Notation**:
      - Used to describe the set of values that satisfy an inequality.
         - Example: The solution to \( x \geq 1 \) is \( [1, \infty) \), where the square bracket indicates that 1 is included, and the parenthesis indicates that infinity is not a specific value and cannot be included.

3. **Set-Builder Notation**:
      - Describes the solution set using a condition on the variable.
         - Example: The solution to \( x \geq 1 \) can also be written as \( \{x \mid x \geq 1\} \), meaning "the set of all \( x \) such that \( x \geq 1 \)."

## **Examples of Inequalities**

1. **Linear Inequality**:
      - \( 5x - 3 \geq 12 \)
      - Solution: \( x \geq 3 \)

2. **Quadratic Inequality**:
      - \( x^2 - 4x + 3 \leq 0 \)
      - Factor: \( (x - 1)(x - 3) \leq 0 \)
      - Solution: \( 1 \leq x \leq 3 \)

3. **Rational Inequality**:
      - \( \frac{2x + 1}{x - 3} > 0 \)
      - Solution: \( x > 3 \)

4. **Absolute Value Inequality**:
      - \( |x - 5| < 3 \)
      - Solution: \( 2 < x < 8 \)

## **Summary**

Inequalities are fundamental in mathematics, expressing the relationships between quantities where one is larger or smaller than the other. The symbols and rules associated with inequalities differ slightly from those of equations, particularly when it comes to multiplying or dividing by negative numbers. Inequalities can take various forms, including linear, quadratic, and rational, and their solutions can be represented using set notation, interval notation, or graphically on a number line.
