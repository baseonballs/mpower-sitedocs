## Step-by-Step Solution

We are using the <span style="color: red; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">isolation method</span>, which involves moving all constants to the right-hand side (<span style="color: black; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">RHS</span>), and isolating the variable term on the left-hand side (<span style="color: black; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">LHS</span>). Let's proceed carefully.

### <span style="color: orange; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Step 1</span>: Start with the given equation
\[
\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{2} = \sqrt{32}
\]

### **Step 2**: Subtract \(\sqrt{2}\) from both sides
To isolate the variable \(\sqrt{x}\), we subtract \(\sqrt{2}\) from both sides of the equation. This uses the **Subtraction Property of Equality**, which states that for any numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), if \(a = b\), then \(a - c = b - c\). Applying this property to the equation:

\[
\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{2} - \sqrt{2} = \sqrt{32} - \sqrt{2}
\]

On the left-hand side, \(\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{2} = 0\), so we are left with:

\[
\sqrt{x} = \sqrt{32} - \sqrt{2}
\]

### **Step 3**: Simplify the right-hand side
Now, simplify the terms on the RHS. We first simplify \(\sqrt{32}\) using the **Product Property of Square Roots**, which states \(\sqrt{ab} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\):

\[
\sqrt{32} = \sqrt{16 \times 2} = \sqrt{16} \times \sqrt{2} = 4\sqrt{2}
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
\sqrt{x} = 4\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{2}
\]

### **Step 4**: Factor out \(\sqrt{2}\)
Now, factor out \(\sqrt{2}\) from the RHS using the **Distributive Property**:

\[
\sqrt{x} = (4 - 1)\sqrt{2}
\]

Simplifying the factor:
\[
\sqrt{x} = 3\sqrt{2}
\]

### **Step 5**: Square both sides
To eliminate the square root on the LHS, square both sides of the equation. This uses the **Square Property of Equality**, which states that if \(a = b\), then \(a^2 = b^2\):

\[
(\sqrt{x})^2 = (3\sqrt{2})^2
\]

On the left-hand side:

\[
(\sqrt{x})^2 = x
\]

On the right-hand side, use the **Product Property of Exponents**, which states \((ab)^2 = a^2 \times b^2\):

\[
(3\sqrt{2})^2 = 3^2 \times (\sqrt{2})^2 = 9 \times 2 = 18
\]

Thus, the equation becomes:

\[
x = 18
\]

### **Step 6**: Check the solution
To verify, substitute \(x = 18\) back into the original equation:

\[
\sqrt{18} + \sqrt{2} = \sqrt{32}
\]

Simplify \(\sqrt{18}\):

\[
\sqrt{18} = \sqrt{9 \times 2} = \sqrt{9} \times \sqrt{2} = 3\sqrt{2}
\]

So the left-hand side becomes:

\[
3\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2} = 4\sqrt{2}
\]

The right-hand side is:

\[
\sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}
\]

Since both sides are equal, \(x = 18\) is correct.
