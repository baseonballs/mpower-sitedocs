# Algebra - "Solve for x" Challenge

## Problem Statement

Solve for $x$ and $y$. You should have coordinate pairs ($x$, $y$) for each equation:

\[
   x^x = 256 
\]

---

## Step-by-Step Solution

To solve the equation \( x^x = 256 \), follow these steps:

### Step 1: Express 256 as a power of a base

First, express 256 as a power of 2, because it simplifies solving equations involving exponents:

\[
256 = 2^8
\]

Thus, the equation \( x^x = 256 \) can be rewritten as:

\[
x^x = 2^8
\]

### Step 2: Try simple values for \( x \)

Check if any integer value for \( x \) makes \( x^x = 2^8 \) true.

1. **Try \( x = 2 \)**:

\[
2^2 = 4
\]

   This does not match \( 2^8 \).

2. **Try \( x = 4 \)**:

\[
4^4 = (2^2)^4 = 2^{8} = 256
\]

   This matches \( 2^8 \).

### Step 3: Verify the solution

The value \( x = 4 \) satisfies the equation:

\[
4^4 = 256
\]

Thus, \( x = 4 \) is a solution.
