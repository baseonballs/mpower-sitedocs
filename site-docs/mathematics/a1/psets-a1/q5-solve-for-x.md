## Step-by-Step Solution

To determine the equation of a straight line that has a y-intercept of 1 and is perpendicular to the line represented by the equation \( y = 2x + 3 \), follow these steps:

### <span style="color: orange; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Step 1</span>: Determine the slope of the perpendicular line

The given line is \( y = 2x + 3 \). In this slope-intercept form, \( y = mx + b \), the slope \( m \) is 2.

For a line perpendicular to this one, the slope will be the negative reciprocal of 2. 

\[
m_{\text{perpendicular}} = -\frac{1}{2}
\]

### <span style="color: orange; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Step 2</span>: Use the slope-intercept form to write the new line's equation

The general form of the equation of a line is:

\[
y = mx + b
\]

where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the y-intercept.

Given:
- The slope of the perpendicular line is \( -\frac{1}{2} \).
- The y-intercept is 1.

Substitute these values into the slope-intercept form:

\[
y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 1
\]

### <span style="color: orange; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Step 3</span>: Write the final equation

The equation of the straight line that is perpendicular to \( y = 2x + 3 \) and has a y-intercept of 1 is:

\[
y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 1
\]

## <span style="color: green; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Solution</span>:

- **Slope of the given line**: 2
- **Slope of the perpendicular line**: \(-\frac{1}{2}\)
- **Y-intercept of the perpendicular line**: 1

Thus, the equation of the desired line is:

\[
y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 1
\]
