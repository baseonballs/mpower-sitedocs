## 1. **Linear Equations (Standard Form)**

A **linear equation** in two variables is typically of the form:
\[
ax + by = c
\]
where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants.

### Solving for \(x\):
To isolate \(x\), you can rearrange the equation:

\[
ax = c - by \implies x = \frac{c - by}{a}
\]

### Techniques:
- **Rearranging terms**: Move the \(by\) term to the other side of the equation.
- **Division**: Divide by \(a\) to isolate \(x\).

### Gotchas:
- **Division by zero**: Make sure \(a \neq 0\), or the equation is invalid for solving \(x\).
- **Interpreting results**: Since the equation has two variables, \(x\) is expressed in terms of \(y\), meaning the solution is not a single number unless you also know the value of \(y\).

## 2. **Substitution Method (for Systems of Equations)**

In systems of two equations with two variables (e.g., \(x\) and \(y\)), the **substitution method** can be used to solve for one variable at a time. For example, with:

\[
x + 2y = 6 \quad \text{(1)}
\]

\[
3x - y = 7 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

### Steps:
1. Solve one of the equations for \(x\) or \(y\). Let’s solve (1) for \(x\):

\[
x = 6 - 2y
\]

2. Substitute this expression for \(x\) in equation (2):

\[
3(6 - 2y) - y = 7
\]

3. Solve for \(y\) and then back-substitute to find \(x\).

### Gotchas:
- **Simplification errors**: When substituting, be careful with distributing and combining like terms.
- **No solution or infinite solutions**: Some systems may have no solution (parallel lines) or infinitely many solutions (the same line).

## 3. **Elimination Method (for Systems of Equations)**

Another method for systems of two equations is **elimination**, which involves adding or subtracting equations to eliminate one variable.

### Example:

\[
2x + 3y = 12 \quad \text{(1)}
\]

\[
4x - 3y = 6 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

### Steps:
1. Add equations (1) and (2) to eliminate \(y\):

\[
(2x + 3y) + (4x - 3y) = 12 + 6
\]

   This simplifies to:

\[
6x = 18
\]

2. Solve for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{18}{6} = 3
\]

3. Substitute \(x = 3\) back into either equation to solve for \(y\).

### Gotchas:
- **Sign errors**: Ensure correct signs when adding or subtracting equations.
- **Inconsistent or dependent systems**: Like in substitution, parallel lines (no solution) or overlapping lines (infinitely many solutions) may appear.

## 4. **Nonlinear Equations**

When dealing with nonlinear equations (e.g., quadratic, exponential), solving for \(x\) can become more complex. Here’s an example of a quadratic equation in two variables:

\[
x^2 + y^2 = 25
\]

This represents a circle, and solving for \(x\) involves isolating \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = 25 - y^2 \implies x = \pm \sqrt{25 - y^2}
\]

### Gotchas:
- **Square root**: Don’t forget the \(\pm\) when taking square roots, as both positive and negative roots are possible.
- **Domain restrictions**: Ensure that the expression under the square root is non-negative (\(25 - y^2 \geq 0\)).

---

## 5. **Graphical Interpretation**

For two-variable equations, solving for \(x\) often gives a relationship between \(x\) and \(y\). Graphically:
- **Linear equations** represent straight lines.
- **Quadratic equations** like \(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\) represent conic sections (e.g., circles, parabolas).

### Gotchas:
- **Intersection points**: If solving a system graphically, the solution corresponds to the intersection points of the graphs. Be aware of cases where the graphs don’t intersect (no solution) or overlap entirely (infinite solutions).

---

These are some of the primary techniques for solving for \(x\) in two-variable equations. Depending on the nature of the equations, one method may be more efficient or appropriate than another.
