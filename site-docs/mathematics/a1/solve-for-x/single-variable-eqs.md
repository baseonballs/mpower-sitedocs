# Solving for \( x \) in Single Variable Equations

## Introduction to Solving for \( x \)

In algebra, solving for \( x \) refers to the process of isolating the variable \( x \) to find its value that satisfies a given equation. The simplest cases involve linear equations, but before arriving at them, itâ€™s important to explore the various methods used in solving different types of single-variable equations. These methods build from basic arithmetic, through simple algebraic manipulations, all the way to solving more complex linear equations.

---

### 1. **Basic Arithmetic Equations**
The simplest form of solving for \( x \) begins with basic arithmetic, where the operations directly apply to finding the value of \( x \).

**Example**:

\[ x + 5 = 12 \]

Here, you need to isolate \( x \) by performing inverse operations (operations that cancel each other out):

\[
x = 12 - 5 = 7
\]

This is the most straightforward approach, requiring only subtraction to remove the constant from the variable.

---

### 2. **Multiplication and Division**

When equations involve multiplication or division, the goal is still to isolate \( x \), but this time by dividing or multiplying both sides of the equation.

**Example**:

\[ 4x = 20 \]

Here, \( x \) is multiplied by 4, so divide both sides by 4 to isolate \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

Similarly, for division:

\[
\frac{x}{3} = 9
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to get:

\[
x = 9 \times 3 = 27
\]

---

### 3. **Equations Involving Fractions**
When fractions are involved, you may need to eliminate the denominator before isolating \( x \). The strategy is to multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator to simplify.

**Example**:

\[
\frac{x}{5} + 2 = 7
\]

First, subtract 2 from both sides:

\[
\frac{x}{5} = 5
\]

Now, multiply both sides by 5:

\[
x = 5 \times 5 = 25
\]

Another example might involve fractions on both sides:

\[
\frac{x}{3} = \frac{6}{4}
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to get:

\[
x = \frac{6}{4} \times 3 = \frac{18}{4} = 4.5
\]

---

### 4. **Distributive Property**
In cases where the variable appears inside parentheses, you often need to apply the distributive property. This allows you to remove parentheses and simplify the equation.

**Example**:

\[
2(x + 3) = 14
\]

First, apply the distributive property:

\[
2x + 6 = 14
\]

Now, subtract 6 from both sides:

\[
2x = 8
\]

Finally, divide by 2:

\[
x = 4
\]

---

### 5. **Equations with Variables on Both Sides**
When \( x \) appears on both sides of the equation, the first step is to move all terms involving \( x \) to one side and constants to the other.

**Example**:

\[
5x - 3 = 2x + 9
\]

First, subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:

\[
3x - 3 = 9
\]

Next, add 3 to both sides:

\[
3x = 12
\]

Finally, divide by 3:

\[
x = 4
\]

---

### 6. **Linear Equations**
Linear equations are equations of the form \( ax + b = 0 \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants, and \( x \) is the variable. The solution to such equations is found by isolating \( x \).

**General Formula**:

Given \( ax + b = 0 \), solve for \( x \) by:

\[
x = -\frac{b}{a}
\]

**Example**:

For \( 3x + 6 = 0 \), subtract 6 from both sides:

\[
3x = -6
\]

Now, divide by 3:

\[
x = -2
\]

Linear equations also generalize to cases with more complicated expressions on either side, but the principle remains the same: rearrange terms to isolate \( x \).

---

### 7. **Method of Substitution (for systems of equations)**
Though primarily used for systems of equations, substitution is a method that can also apply when \( x \) appears as part of a complex function. You solve for \( x \) in terms of another expression and substitute it back into the equation.

---

### 8. **Graphical Method**
In a graphical context, solving for \( x \) means finding the value of \( x \) where a given linear equation intersects the x-axis (i.e., where \( y = 0 \)). This involves plotting the equation and determining the point of intersection with the x-axis, which represents the solution.

For example, in the equation \( 2x - 4 = 0 \), solving for \( x \) gives:

\[
x = 2
\]

Graphing this as a line would show the intersection at \( (2, 0) \).

---

### 9. **Trial and Error / Guess and Check**
In some cases, especially for simple equations or when teaching elementary methods, trial and error or "guess and check" methods are used. By plugging different values of \( x \) into the equation, one can manually determine which value satisfies the equation.

---

## Summary
Solving for \( x \) is a fundamental skill in algebra, forming the foundation for more complex problem-solving techniques. Whether through simple arithmetic manipulations, applying the distributive property, or handling linear equations with variables on both sides, the objective remains consistent: isolate \( x \) by using inverse operations and algebraic principles.

Each method has its place, and the complexity increases from arithmetic approaches to linear equations, preparing learners for further algebraic exploration, such as solving systems of equations or working with non-linear equations.
