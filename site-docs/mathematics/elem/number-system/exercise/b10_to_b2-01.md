# Exercise - Base 10 conversion to base 2

Here's an exercise to practice converting a base 10 (decimal) number to base 2 (binary):

### Exercise

**Convert the decimal number 156 to its binary equivalent.**

### Solution

To convert the decimal number 156 to binary, follow these steps:

1. **Divide the Number by 2**:
   - Write down the decimal number.
   - Divide it by 2, and record the quotient and the remainder.

2. **Repeat the Process**:
   - Continue dividing the quotient by 2, recording each remainder, until the quotient is 0.

3. **Read the Remainders Backwards**:
   - The binary equivalent is obtained by reading the remainders from bottom to top.

Let's go through the process step by step:

1. **Divide 156 by 2**:
   \[
   156 \div 2 = 78 \text{ with a remainder of } 0
   \]

2. **Divide 78 by 2**:
   \[
   78 \div 2 = 39 \text{ with a remainder of } 0
   \]

3. **Divide 39 by 2**:
   \[
   39 \div 2 = 19 \text{ with a remainder of } 1
   \]

4. **Divide 19 by 2**:
   \[
   19 \div 2 = 9 \text{ with a remainder of } 1
   \]

5. **Divide 9 by 2**:
   \[
   9 \div 2 = 4 \text{ with a remainder of } 1
   \]

6. **Divide 4 by 2**:
   \[
   4 \div 2 = 2 \text{ with a remainder of } 0
   \]

7. **Divide 2 by 2**:
   \[
   2 \div 2 = 1 \text{ with a remainder of } 0
   \]

8. **Divide 1 by 2**:
   \[
   1 \div 2 = 0 \text{ with a remainder of } 1
   \]

Now, list the remainders from bottom to top:
\[
1 \text{ (from the last division)} \\
0 \\
0 \\
1 \\
1 \\
1 \\
0 \\
0 \text{ (from the first division)}
\]

So, the binary representation of 156 is \( 10011100_2 \).

### Answer

The binary equivalent of the decimal number 156 is \( 10011100_2 \).
