# Exercise - Base 10 conversion to base 2

Here's an exercise to practice converting a base 10 (decimal) number to base 2 (binary):

### Exercise

**Convert the decimal number 156 to its binary equivalent.**

### Solution

To convert the decimal number 156 to binary, follow these steps:

1. **Divide the Number by 2**:
   - Write down the decimal number.
   - Divide it by 2, and record the quotient and the remainder.

2. **Repeat the Process**:
   - Continue dividing the quotient by 2, recording each remainder, until the quotient is 0.

3. **Read the Remainders Backwards**:
   - The binary equivalent is obtained by reading the remainders from bottom to top.

Let's go through the process step by step:

1. **Divide 156 by 2**:
   \[
   156 \div 2 = 78 \text{ with a remainder of } 0
   \]

2. **Divide 78 by 2**:
   \[
   78 \div 2 = 39 \text{ with a remainder of } 0
   \]

3. **Divide 39 by 2**:
   \[
   39 \div 2 = 19 \text{ with a remainder of } 1
   \]

4. **Divide 19 by 2**:
   \[
   19 \div 2 = 9 \text{ with a remainder of } 1
   \]

5. **Divide 9 by 2**:
   \[
   9 \div 2 = 4 \text{ with a remainder of } 1
   \]

6. **Divide 4 by 2**:
   \[
   4 \div 2 = 2 \text{ with a remainder of } 0
   \]

7. **Divide 2 by 2**:
   \[
   2 \div 2 = 1 \text{ with a remainder of } 0
   \]

8. **Divide 1 by 2**:
   \[
   1 \div 2 = 0 \text{ with a remainder of } 1
   \]

Now, list the remainders from bottom to top:
\[
1 \text{ (from the last division)} \\
0 \\
0 \\
1 \\
1 \\
1 \\
0 \\
0 \text{ (from the first division)}
\]

So, the binary representation of 156 is \( 10011100_2 \).

### Answer

The binary equivalent of the decimal number 156 is \( 10011100_2 \).

## Algebraic Method

To convert a decimal number to binary using an algebraic method, you can express the decimal number as a sum of powers of 2. Here's how we can use this method to convert the decimal number **156** to binary:

### Algebraic Method:

1. **Step 1: Find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 156.**
   - The powers of 2 are: \( 2^0 = 1 \), \( 2^1 = 2 \), \( 2^2 = 4 \), \( 2^3 = 8 \), \( 2^4 = 16 \), \( 2^5 = 32 \), \( 2^6 = 64 \), \( 2^7 = 128 \), \( 2^8 = 256 \) (which is greater than 156).
   - The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 156 is \( 2^7 = 128 \).

2. **Step 2: Subtract \( 128 \) (i.e., \( 2^7 \)) from 156 and repeat for the remainder.**
   \[
   156 - 128 = 28
   \]

3. **Step 3: Find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 28.**
   - The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 28 is \( 2^4 = 16 \).

4. **Step 4: Subtract \( 16 \) (i.e., \( 2^4 \)) from 28 and repeat for the remainder.**
   \[
   28 - 16 = 12
   \]

5. **Step 5: Find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 12.**
   - The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 12 is \( 2^3 = 8 \).

6. **Step 6: Subtract \( 8 \) (i.e., \( 2^3 \)) from 12 and repeat for the remainder.**
   \[
   12 - 8 = 4
   \]

7. **Step 7: Find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 4.**
   - The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 4 is \( 2^2 = 4 \).

8. **Step 8: Subtract \( 4 \) (i.e., \( 2^2 \)) from 4 and repeat for the remainder.**
   \[
   4 - 4 = 0
   \]
   Now the remainder is 0, so we are done.

### Final Expression:
Now, we have expressed 156 as a sum of powers of 2:
\[
156 = 2^7 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2
\]

### Step 9: Write the binary representation.
Each power of 2 corresponds to a digit in the binary representation. A 1 is placed in the positions of the powers of 2 we used, and a 0 is placed in the positions we skipped.

- \( 2^7 = 128 \)
- \( 2^6 = 0 \)
- \( 2^5 = 0 \)
- \( 2^4 = 16 \)
- \( 2^3 = 8 \)
- \( 2^2 = 4 \)
- \( 2^1 = 0 \)
- \( 2^0 = 0 \)

Thus, the binary representation of 156 is:
\[
10011100_2
\]

This matches the result we obtained earlier using the division method.
