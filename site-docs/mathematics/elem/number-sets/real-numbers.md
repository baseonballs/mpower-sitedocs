Real numbers form a fundamental concept in mathematics and include all the numbers that can be represented on a number line. This set is denoted by **ℝ** and includes both rational and irrational numbers. Here's a breakdown of real numbers and their properties:

## 1. Types of Real Numbers

### **1.1 Rational Numbers**:
   - Numbers that can be expressed as a fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \), where \( p \) and \( q \) are integers and \( q \neq 0 \). 
   - Includes integers (e.g., -3, 0, 5), fractions (e.g., \( \frac{1}{2} \), \( \frac{-3}{4} \)), and terminating or repeating decimals (e.g., 0.75, 0.333...).

### **1.2 Irrational Numbers**:
   - Numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \).
   - These numbers have non-terminating and non-repeating decimal expansions. Examples include \( \sqrt{2} \), \( \pi \), and \( e \) (Euler's number).

###**2. Subsets of Real Numbers**:

- **Natural Numbers** (ℕ): The set of positive integers starting from 1 (i.e., 1, 2, 3, ...).
- **Whole Numbers**: Natural numbers plus 0 (i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, ...).
- **Integers** (ℤ): Includes negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers (i.e., ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...).
- **Rational Numbers** (ℚ): Numbers that can be written as fractions.
- **Irrational Numbers**: As mentioned, numbers that cannot be written as fractions.

## 3. Properties of Real Numbers

1. **Closure**: The set of real numbers is closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (except by 0).
2. **Commutativity**: For addition and multiplication, real numbers satisfy \( a + b = b + a \) and \( a \times b = b \times a \).
3. **Associativity**: Addition and multiplication are associative: \( (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) \) and \( (a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c) \).
4. **Distributivity**: Multiplication distributes over addition: \( a \times (b + c) = (a \times b) + (a \times c) \).
5. **Identity Elements**: The additive identity is 0 (since \( a + 0 = a \)), and the multiplicative identity is 1 (since \( a \times 1 = a \)).
6. **Inverses**: Every real number \( a \) has an additive inverse \( -a \), and every non-zero real number has a multiplicative inverse \( \frac{1}{a} \).

## 4. Real Numbers on a Number Line

- The number line is a visual representation where each point corresponds to a unique real number.
- Positive numbers lie to the right of zero, while negative numbers lie to the left.
- Between any two real numbers, there are infinitely many other real numbers, making the set **dense**.

## 5. Applications of Real Numbers

- **Measurement**: Real numbers are used to measure quantities like distance, temperature, and time, which can take both integer and non-integer values.
- **Algebra and Calculus**: They form the basis for solving equations and performing calculus operations like limits, derivatives, and integrals.
- **Geometry**: Real numbers are used to describe lengths, areas, and volumes, particularly involving irrational numbers like \( \pi \).

Real numbers are essential for understanding nearly every aspect of mathematics and its applications in science, engineering, and everyday life.

### 3. **Convergence of a Decimal Expansion**
   A repeating decimal \( 0.\overline{142857} \) represents a rational number. Convert this repeating decimal into a fraction and simplify.

### 4. **Sum of an Irrational and Rational Number**
   If \( x \) is an irrational number and \( y \) is a rational number, is \( x + y \) rational or irrational? Prove your answer with a specific example.

### 5. **Nested Radicals**
   Simplify the following expression, if possible:
   \[
   \sqrt{5 + 2\sqrt{6}}
   \]
   Provide detailed steps and reasoning.

   Divide the irrational number \( \pi \) by the irrational number \( \sqrt{2} \). Is the result always irrational? Justify your answer.

### 9. **Rationalizing Complex Denominators**
   Rationalize the denominator and simplify:
   \[

   \]
   Provide step-by-step simplification.

### 10. **Irrational Powers**
   Is it possible for the expression \( \left( \sqrt{2} \right)^{\sqrt{2}} \) to be rational? Investigate and either prove or disprove this.

These problems challenge understanding of the nature of real numbers, including rational and irrational numbers, and their properties under various operations.
