# Integers - \( \mathbb{Z} \)

**Integers** are a fundamental concept in mathematics, extending the concept of natural numbers to include negative numbers and zero. They are used in a wide range of mathematical operations and theories and form the basis for more advanced number systems. This discourse provides an in-depth look at integers, their properties, and their role in mathematics.

## **1. Definition and Basic Properties**

### **1.1 Definition**

The set of integers, denoted by \( \mathbb{Z} \), includes all positive whole numbers, negative whole numbers, and zero. Mathematically, the set of integers is represented as:

\[
\mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}
\]

**Example:** The integers include numbers like -4, 0, 7, and 15.

### **1.2 Basic Properties**

- **Closure Property:** The set of integers is closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication. This means performing these operations on integers always results in an integer.
- **Non-closure Property:** The set of integers is not closed under division. Dividing one integer by another does not always result in an integer (e.g., \( 7 \div 2 = 3.5 \)).
- **Ordering:** Integers are ordered in a linear fashion. For any two integers \( a \) and \( b \), exactly one of the following is true: \( a > b \), \( a < b \), or \( a = b \).

## **2. Arithmetic Operations with Integers**

### **2.1 Addition**

- **Commutative Property:** For any integers \( a \) and \( b \), \( a + b = b + a \).
- **Associative Property:** For any integers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), \( (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) \).
- **Identity Element:** The identity element for addition is 0. For any integer \( a \), \( a + 0 = a \).
- **Additive Inverse:** For every integer \( a \), there exists an integer \( -a \) such that \( a + (-a) = 0 \).

**Example:**

\[
5 + (-3) = 2
\]

\[
-7 + 4 = -3
\]

### **2.2 Subtraction**

- **Not Commutative:** Subtraction is not commutative; \( a - b \neq b - a \) in general.
- **Not Associative:** Subtraction is not associative; \( (a - b) - c \neq a - (b - c) \).

**Example:**

\[
7 - 3 = 4
\]

\[
3 - 7 = -4
\]

### **2.3 Multiplication**

- **Commutative Property:** For any integers \( a \) and \( b \), \( a \times b = b \times a \).
- **Associative Property:** For any integers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), \( (a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c) \).
- **Distributive Property:** For any integers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), \( a \times (b + c) = (a \times b) + (a \times c) \).
- **Multiplicative Identity:** The identity element for multiplication is 1. For any integer \( a \), \( a \times 1 = a \).
- **Multiplicative Inverse:** For nonzero integers, there is no multiplicative inverse in the set of integers. Inverse exists in the rational numbers.

**Example:**

\[
4 \times (-3) = -12
\]

\[
-5 \times 7 = -35
\]

### **2.4 Division**

- **Non-closure Property:** Division of integers does not always result in an integer. For example, \( 7 \div 3 = 2.333\ldots \) (not an integer).
- **Quotient and Remainder:** For integers \( a \) and \( b \) (with \( b \neq 0 \)), there exist unique integers \( q \) (quotient) and \( r \) (remainder) such that:

\[
a = b \times q + r
\]

where \( 0 \leq r < |b| \).

**Example:**

\[
17 \div 5 = 3 \text{ with a remainder of } 2
\]

---

## **3. Properties and Theorems**

### **3.1 Absolute Value**

- The **absolute value** of an integer \( a \), denoted by \( |a| \), is the non-negative value of \( a \). It is defined as:

\[
|a| = 
\begin{cases} 
a & \text{if } a \geq 0 \\
-a & \text{if } a < 0 
\end{cases}
\]

**Example:**

\[
| -7 | = 7
\]

\[
| 4 | = 4
\]

### **3.2 Integer Properties**

- **Even and Odd Integers:**
  - An **even integer** is divisible by 2 (e.g., -4, 0, 2).
  - An **odd integer** is not divisible by 2 (e.g., -3, 1, 5).
- **Prime and Composite Numbers:**
  - A **prime number** is a positive integer greater than 1 with exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself (e.g., 2, 3, 5).
  - A **composite number** is a positive integer greater than 1 that has more than two distinct positive divisors (e.g., 4, 6, 8).

### **3.3 Modular Arithmetic**

- **Definition:** Modular arithmetic involves integers and a modulus \( n \). Two integers \( a \) and \( b \) are congruent modulo \( n \) if \( a \) and \( b \) have the same remainder when divided by \( n \), denoted:

\[
a \equiv b \pmod{n}
\]

**Example:**

\[
23 \equiv 5 \pmod{9}
\]
