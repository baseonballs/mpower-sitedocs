# Complex Magnitude

Complex magnitude, often referred to as the modulus or absolute value of a complex number, is a fundamental concept in complex analysis and is crucial in various fields such as engineering, physics, and mathematics. 

## Definition

For a complex number \( z \) expressed in the form:

\[
z = a + bi
\]

where \( a \) is the real part and \( b \) is the imaginary part (with \( i \) being the imaginary unit, defined as \( i^2 = -1 \)), the magnitude of \( z \), denoted as \( |z| \), is given by:

\[
|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
\]

## Geometric Interpretation

Geometrically, the complex magnitude represents the distance from the origin (0,0) in the complex plane (or Argand plane) to the point represented by the complex number \( z \). The real part \( a \) corresponds to the horizontal axis (x-axis), while the imaginary part \( b \) corresponds to the vertical axis (y-axis). The relationship can be visualized as the hypotenuse of a right triangle where the sides are \( a \) and \( b \).

## Properties

1. **Non-negativity**: The magnitude \( |z| \) is always non-negative, meaning \( |z| \geq 0 \) for any complex number \( z \). It is zero only when \( z = 0 \).

2. **Multiplicative Property**: The magnitude of the product of two complex numbers equals the product of their magnitudes:

\[
|z_1 z_2| = |z_1| |z_2|
\]

3. **Triangle Inequality**: The magnitude adheres to the triangle inequality, which states that for any two complex numbers \( z_1 \) and \( z_2 \):

\[
|z_1 + z_2| \leq |z_1| + |z_2|
\]

This property highlights the geometric interpretation of distances in the complex plane.
