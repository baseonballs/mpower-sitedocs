# Complex Numbers

## 1. **Introduction to Complex Numbers**
Complex numbers extend the idea of the number system, starting with real numbers and introducing an imaginary component. They are used in many fields such as engineering, physics, and applied mathematics to handle quantities that real numbers alone cannot represent.

**Definition:**
A complex number is a number of the form:

\[
z = a + bi
\]

where:

- \( a \) is the **real part** of the complex number (\( \text{Re}(z) = a \)).
- \( b \) is the **imaginary part** of the complex number (\( \text{Im}(z) = b \)).
- \( i \) is the imaginary unit, defined as \( i^2 = -1 \).

For example, \( z = 3 + 4i \) is a complex number where \( a = 3 \) (real part) and \( b = 4 \) (imaginary part).
