### 1. **Irrational and Rational Product**
   Prove whether the product of a non-zero rational number and an irrational number is always irrational. Provide an example to justify your answer.

### 2. **Density of Real Numbers**
   Find two distinct irrational numbers between 1.2 and 1.3. Explain why your examples satisfy the conditions.

### 3. **Convergence of a Decimal Expansion**
   A repeating decimal \( 0.\overline{142857} \) represents a rational number. Convert this repeating decimal into a fraction and simplify.

### 4. **Sum of an Irrational and Rational Number**
   If \( x \) is an irrational number and \( y \) is a rational number, is \( x + y \) rational or irrational? Prove your answer with a specific example.

### 5. **Nested Radicals**
   Simplify the following expression, if possible:
   \[
   \sqrt{5 + 2\sqrt{6}}
   \]
   Provide detailed steps and reasoning.

### 6. **Limits and Irrational Numbers**
   Consider the sequence defined by \( a_n = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n \). Show that \( \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 0 \), and explain why this limit holds for any real number base \( 0 < r < 1 \).

### 7. **Operations with Irrational Numbers**
   Is the sum of \( \sqrt{2} \) and \( \sqrt{3} \) rational or irrational? Prove your result mathematically.

### 8. **Irrational Division**
   Divide the irrational number \( \pi \) by the irrational number \( \sqrt{2} \). Is the result always irrational? Justify your answer.

### 9. **Rationalizing Complex Denominators**
   Rationalize the denominator and simplify:
   \[
   \frac{3}{\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}}
   \]
   Provide step-by-step simplification.

### 10. **Irrational Powers**
   Is it possible for the expression \( \left( \sqrt{2} \right)^{\sqrt{2}} \) to be rational? Investigate and either prove or disprove this.

These problems challenge understanding of the nature of real numbers, including rational and irrational numbers, and their properties under various operations.
