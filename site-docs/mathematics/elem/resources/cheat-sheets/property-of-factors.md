# Cheatsheets - Properties of Factors

## Key Properties of Factors

1. **Definition**: A factor of a number \(n\) is an integer that divides \(n\) without leaving a remainder.

    - Example: Factors of 12 are \(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\).

2. **Factor Pairs**: Factors come in pairs. If \(f\) is a factor of \(n\), then \(n/f\) is also a factor.

    - Example: Factor pairs of 24 are \((1, 24), (2, 12), (3, 8), (4, 6)\).

3. **1 and the Number Itself**: Every number has 1 and itself as factors.

    - Example: Factors of 7 include 1 and 7.

4. **Finite Set of Factors**: A non-zero integer has a finite number of factors, determined by its prime factorization.

    - Example: \(36 = 2^2 \times 3^2\) has 9 factors.

5. **Symmetry in Factors**: If \(a\) divides \(b\), then \(b/a\) is also a factor of \(b\), forming symmetrical pairs.
