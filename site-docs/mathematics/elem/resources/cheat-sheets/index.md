- **<span style="color: brown; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">LCM</span>** - The **LCM** (Lowest Common Multiple) is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors
- **<span style="color: brown; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">GCF</span>** - The **GCF** (Greatest Common Factor) is the product of the lowest powers of common prime factors.
- The relationship between the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** and the **Greatest Common Factor (GCF)** of two numbers \( a \) and \( b \) can be expressed by the following formula:

\[
\text{LCM}(a, b) \times \text{GCF}(a, b) = |a \times b|
\]

thus the LCM is:

\[
\text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCF}(a, b)}
\]

and the GCF is:

\[
\text{GCF}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{LCM}(a, b)}
\]

- **<span style="color: brown; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Prime</span>**:
    - for $n$ > 1, 2 distinct factors: 1 and itself
    - building blocks of all natural numbers > 1

    - 2 is the smallest and the only even prime number since $2n$ are no longer primes.

- **<span style="color: brown; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Coprime or Relative Prime</span>**:
    - when \(\text{GCF}(a, b) = 1\); In other words, no common factors other than 1.

- **<span style="color: brown; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic</span>**: Every natural number greater > 1 can be uniquely expressed as a product of prime numbers, disregarding the order of the factors.

- **<span style="color: brown; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Fundamental Rule of Algebra</span>** - states that every non-constant polynomial function with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. Moreover, a polynomial of degree $n$ will have exactly $n$ roots in the complex number system, counting multiplicities.
