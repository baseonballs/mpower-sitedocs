- LCM - The **LCM** (Lowest Common Multiple) is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors
- GCF - The **GCF** (Greatest Common Factor) is the product of the lowest powers of common prime factors.
- The relationship between the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** and the **Greatest Common Factor (GCF)** (also known as Greatest Common Divisor, GCD) of two numbers \( a \) and \( b \) can be expressed by the following formula:

\[
\text{LCM}(a, b) \times \text{GCF}(a, b) = |a \times b|
\]

- Prime:
    - for $n$ > 1, 2 distinct factors: 1 and itself
    - building blocks of all natural numbers > 1

- Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic: Every natural number greater > 1 can be uniquely expressed as a product of prime numbers, disregarding the order of the factors.

- Fundamental Rule of Algebra - states that every non-constant polynomial function with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. Moreover, a polynomial of degree $n$ will have exactly $n$ roots in the complex number system, counting multiplicities.
