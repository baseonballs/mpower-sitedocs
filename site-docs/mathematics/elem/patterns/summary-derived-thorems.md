# Theorems Derived from Pattern Observation in Numbers

Observing patterns in numbers has led to several important mathematical theorems. Here are some notable examples:

## 1. **Fermat's Last Theorem**

**Statement**: There are no positive integers \( x, y, \) and \( z \) that satisfy \( x^n + y^n = z^n \) for any integer value of \( n > 2 \).

**Pattern Observed**: For various values of \( n \), the equation \( x^n + y^n = z^n \) holds true for \( n = 2 \) (Pythagorean triples), but not for \( n > 2 \). This pattern of non-existence for \( n > 2 \) led to the formulation and proof of the theorem by Andrew Wiles in 1994.

## 2. **Pythagorean Theorem**

**Statement**: In a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (\( c \)) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (\( a \) and \( b \)):

\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\]

**Pattern Observed**: The pattern of relationships among the side lengths of right triangles and the consistent result of this relationship across various triangles led to the formalization of this theorem.

## 3. **Euclid's Theorem on Primes**

**Statement**: There are infinitely many prime numbers.

**Pattern Observed**: By observing the distribution of prime numbers and the gaps between them, Euclid demonstrated that there cannot be a finite list of all primes, leading to the theorem's proof.

## 4. **The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic**

**Statement**: Every integer greater than 1 can be factored uniquely into prime numbers, up to the order of the factors.

**Pattern Observed**: Patterns in the factorization of numbers into primes revealed that every number has a unique factorization. This pattern led to the theorem stating the uniqueness of prime factorization.

## 5. **Wilson's Theorem**

**Statement**: A natural number \( p \) is a prime if and only if \( (p - 1)! \equiv -1 \pmod{p} \).

**Pattern Observed**: Observing the factorial values and their residues modulo prime numbers led to the discovery of this theorem. For prime numbers, the factorials always leave a remainder of -1 when divided by the prime number.

## 6. **Binomial Theorem**

**Statement**: For any non-negative integer \( n \) and any numbers \( a \) and \( b \), the expansion of \( (a + b)^n \) is:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

**Pattern Observed**: Patterns in the expansion of binomials for small \( n \) values and the coefficients (Pascal’s Triangle) led to the formalization of this theorem.

## 7. **Gauss’s Theorem on Summing Consecutive Integers**

**Statement**: The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by:

\[
S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

**Pattern Observed**: Observing the pattern in the sum of consecutive integers and the consistent result of pairing terms led to the formulation of this summation formula.

## 8. **Euler’s Formula for Polyhedra**

**Statement**: For any convex polyhedron, the number of vertices \( V \), edges \( E \), and faces \( F \) satisfy:

\[
V - E + F = 2
\]

**Pattern Observed**: Euler observed patterns in various polyhedra, discovering that this relationship holds true, leading to this fundamental topological result.

## 9. **The Sum of Cubes**

**Statement**: The sum of the first \( n \) cubes is the square of the sum of the first \( n \) integers:

\[
\left( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \right)^2
\]

**Pattern Observed**: The pattern of summing cubes and noticing that the result matches the square of the sum of the integers led to this result.

## 10. **Laws of Exponents**

**Statement**: For any numbers \( a \) and \( b \), and any integers \( m \) and \( n \):

\[
a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}
\]

**Pattern Observed**: The pattern in multiplying powers of the same base and observing the additive property of exponents led to the formalization of the laws of exponents.

## **Summary**

These theorems showcase how **patterns in numbers**—whether in sequences, factorizations, or modular arithmetic—serve as the foundation for deeper mathematical understanding and formalization. Recognizing these patterns often leads to discovering new results and generalizing principles across different areas of mathematics.
