# Examples of Dervied Formulas through Patterns

Here are several examples of **formulas derived from patterns** in mathematics, where identifying consistent relationships helps in forming general rules:

## 1. **Sum of Natural Numbers**

The formula for the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers:

\[
S = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]

**Pattern**: The sum is derived by noticing that pairing the first and last terms, second and second-to-last, and so on, always gives the same total. This is a pattern of pairing numbers.

## 2. **Sum of Squares of Natural Numbers**

The sum of squares of the first \( n \) natural numbers:

\[
S = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
\]

**Pattern**: Recognized from calculating the sum of square values for different \( n \) values and generalizing the result.

## 3. **Sum of Cubes of Natural Numbers**

The sum of cubes of the first \( n \) natural numbers:

\[
S = \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \right)^2
\]

**Pattern**: Observed from realizing that the sum of cubes is the square of the sum of the first \( n \) numbers, showing a relationship between squares and cubes.

## 4. **Quadratic Expansion (Binomial Theorem)**

The general expansion of \( (a + b)^2 \):

\[
(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
\]

**Pattern**: This is recognized by expanding \( (a + b)(a + b) \) and seeing how the terms consistently appear, including the cross-term \( ab \).

## 5. **Pythagorean Theorem**

In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides:

\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\]

**Pattern**: Observed by cutting squares off the triangle's sides and noticing that their areas follow this consistent relationship.

## 6. **Arithmetic Sequence Formula**

The general term for an arithmetic sequence:

\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
\]

**Pattern**: Derived by recognizing the consistent addition of the common difference \( d \) between terms.

## 7. **Geometric Sequence Formula**

The general term for a geometric sequence:

\[
a_n = a_1 r^{n-1}
\]

**Pattern**: Identified from the constant ratio \( r \) between consecutive terms in a geometric sequence.

## 8. **Area of a Circle**

The area formula for a circle:

\[
A = \pi r^2
\]

**Pattern**: Derived from observing how circles can be broken into infinitely small sectors, resembling triangles, and using the pattern that relates radius and circumference.

## 9. **Volume of a Sphere**

The formula for the volume of a sphere:

\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]

**Pattern**: Derived from approximating a sphere using smaller 3D objects like pyramids or disks and observing the relationship between radius and volume.

## Summary

In each of these cases, **recognizing patterns** (whether in sums, areas, or sequences) leads to a generalized formula. By noticing how terms repeat or grow in predictable ways, mathematicians can derive rules that apply universally. This process is fundamental to developing mathematical formulas and solving problems more efficiently.
