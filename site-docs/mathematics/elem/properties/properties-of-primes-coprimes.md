# Properties of Prime Numbers and Coprimes

Prime numbers and coprime numbers are central concepts in number theory, each with unique properties that play a crucial role in areas ranging from factorization to modular arithmetic. This discourse will explore the properties of both primes and coprimes, highlighting their definitions, characteristics, and relationships to each other.

## **1. Prime Numbers: The Building Blocks of Numbers**

### 1.1 **Definition of Prime Numbers**
A **prime number** is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. In other words, a prime number \(p\) satisfies the following:
- If \(p = a \times b\), then either \(a = 1\) or \(b = 1\).

- **Example**: The first few prime numbers are \(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, \ldots\).

### 1.2 **Properties of Prime Numbers**
1. **Divisibility**: A prime number can only be divided by 1 and itself, making it indivisible by any other integer.
   - Example: \(7\) is prime because it cannot be divided by any number other than \(1\) and \(7\).

2. **Uniqueness of Prime Factorization**: Every integer greater than 1 can be uniquely expressed as a product of prime numbers, a concept known as the **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic**.
   - Example: \(30 = 2 \times 3 \times 5\), where \(2\), \(3\), and \(5\) are prime.

3. **Infinitude**: There are infinitely many prime numbers. Euclidâ€™s proof shows that for any finite list of primes, a new prime can always be found.
   - Example: Even after identifying the primes \(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\), another prime will always exist beyond this list.

4. **Only Even Prime**: The number \(2\) is the only even prime number. All other even numbers are divisible by \(2\), making them composite.

5. **Applications in Cryptography**: Primes are crucial in encryption algorithms like RSA, where the security of encrypted data relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime components.
