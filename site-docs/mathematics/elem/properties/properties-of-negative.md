Negative numbers extend the number system beyond zero and positive numbers, introducing several important properties. Here’s a comprehensive look at the properties of negative numbers:

### 1. **Definition**
Negative numbers are numbers less than zero. They are represented on the left side of zero on the number line and are denoted with a minus sign.

#### Examples:
- \(-1, -2, -3, -4, \ldots\)

#### Gotchas:
- Negative numbers do not include zero; zero is neither positive nor negative.

---

### 2. **Additive Inverse**
The **additive inverse** of a number is the number that, when added to the original number, results in zero.

- For any negative number \(-a\), its additive inverse is \(a\):
  \[
  -(-a) = a
  \]
- Adding a negative number and its positive counterpart results in zero:
  \[
  -a + a = 0
  \]

#### Examples:
- The additive inverse of \(-5\) is \(5\).
- \(-7 + 7 = 0\).

#### Gotchas:
- This property is crucial for solving equations involving negative numbers.

---

### 3. **Multiplication Properties**

#### a. **Multiplying by Negative Numbers**
- **Product of a positive number and a negative number** is negative:
  \[
  a \times (-b) = - (a \times b)
  \]
- **Product of two negative numbers** is positive:
  \[
  (-a) \times (-b) = a \times b
  \]

#### Examples:
- \( 3 \times (-4) = -12 \)
- \((-3) \times (-5) = 15\)

#### Gotchas:
- The sign rules for multiplication are essential for simplifying expressions and solving problems involving negative numbers.

#### b. **Distributive Property**
- Negative numbers follow the distributive property:
  \[
  - (a + b) = -a - b
  \]
  \[
  a \times (-b) = -(a \times b)
  \]

#### Examples:
- \(- (2 + 3) = -2 - 3 = -5\)
- \(4 \times (-3) = - (4 \times 3) = -12\)

#### Gotchas:
- Applying distributive property helps in expanding and simplifying expressions with negative numbers.

---

### 4. **Addition and Subtraction**

#### a. **Adding Negative Numbers**
- **Adding a negative number** is equivalent to subtracting its absolute value:
  \[
  a + (-b) = a - b
  \]

#### Examples:
- \( 5 + (-3) = 5 - 3 = 2 \)
- \(-4 + (-2) = -6\)

#### Gotchas:
- Adding negative numbers can result in a smaller number or a larger negative number.

#### b. **Subtracting Negative Numbers**
- **Subtracting a negative number** is the same as adding its absolute value:
  \[
  a - (-b) = a + b
  \]

#### Examples:
- \( 7 - (-2) = 7 + 2 = 9 \)
- \( -5 - (-3) = -5 + 3 = -2 \)

#### Gotchas:
- Subtracting a negative number effectively increases the value.

---

### 5. **Order and Comparison**

#### a. **Comparing Negative Numbers**
- On the number line, a number is less than another if it is further to the left.
- More negative numbers are smaller:
  \[
  -5 < -3
  \]
  This is because \(-5\) is further left on the number line than \(-3\).

#### Examples:
- \(-8 < -2\)
- \(-4 < -1\)

#### Gotchas:
- It’s crucial to remember that as numbers become more negative, their value decreases.

---

### 6. **Absolute Value**
- The **absolute value** of a negative number is its distance from zero on the number line, which is always positive:
  \[
  |-a| = a
  \]

#### Examples:
- \(|-7| = 7\)
- \(|-3.5| = 3.5\)

#### Gotchas:
- Absolute value removes the sign, reflecting only the magnitude of the number.

---

### 7. **Zero as a Boundary**
- Negative numbers are located to the left of zero on the number line.
- Zero separates negative numbers from positive numbers.

#### Examples:
- On the number line, \(-2\) is to the left of \(0\), and \(1\) is to the right of \(0\).

#### Gotchas:
- Zero is neither positive nor negative but serves as the boundary between them.

---

### 8. **Negative Numbers in Equations**

#### a. **Solving Equations**
- When solving equations involving negative numbers, apply algebraic principles while respecting the signs.

#### Examples:
- To solve \(x - 7 = -3\), add 7 to both sides to get \(x = 4\).

#### Gotchas:
- Watch for sign changes and ensure correct application of operations.

#### b. **Substitution and Verification**
- Substitute negative numbers into equations carefully and verify solutions.

#### Examples:
- Check if \(-3\) satisfies the equation \(x + 5 = 2\):
  \[
  -3 + 5 = 2 \quad (\text{True})
  \]

#### Gotchas:
- Ensure proper handling of negative signs during substitution and verification.

### Summary of Properties of Negative Numbers:
- **Additive inverse**: \(-(-a) = a\)
- **Multiplication**: Product of a positive and negative is negative; product of two negatives is positive.
- **Addition and Subtraction**: Adding negative numbers is equivalent to subtraction; subtracting negatives is equivalent to addition.
- **Ordering**: More negative numbers are smaller; negative numbers are to the left of zero.
- **Absolute value**: Distance from zero, always positive.
- **Boundary**: Zero separates negative and positive numbers.

Negative numbers are essential for representing quantities less than zero and are widely used in various mathematical operations and real-world contexts.
