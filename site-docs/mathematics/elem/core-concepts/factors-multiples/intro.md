# Factors and Multiples

**Introduction:**
In mathematics, understanding the concepts of factors and multiples is a foundational skill that helps in various areas, such as multiplication, division, and number theory. Factors and multiples are important when solving problems and understanding the relationships between numbers.

## **What are Factors?**

A factor is a number that divides another number exactly, without leaving any remainder. For example, if we look at the number 12, we can find its factors by asking, "What numbers can divide 12 evenly?"

Let's try:

- **1** divides 12 (12 ÷ 1 = 12),
- **2** divides 12 (12 ÷ 2 = 6),
- **3** divides 12 (12 ÷ 3 = 4),
- **4** divides 12 (12 ÷ 4 = 3),
- **6** divides 12 (12 ÷ 6 = 2),
- **12** divides 12 (12 ÷ 12 = 1).

So, the factors of 12 are: **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12**.

The key idea here is that a factor is a number that can be multiplied by another whole number to result in the original number. For example, 2 × 6 = 12, and both 2 and 6 are factors of 12.

## **What are Multiples?**

Multiples, on the other hand, are what you get when you multiply a number by whole numbers. For example, let's look at the multiples of 4:

- 4 × 1 = 4,
- 4 × 2 = 8,
- 4 × 3 = 12,
- 4 × 4 = 16,
- 4 × 5 = 20.

So, the multiples of 4 are **4, 8, 12, 16, 20**, and so on.

Unlike factors, which are limited to a certain number, multiples go on forever. Any number can have an infinite number of multiples!

## **Prime Numbers and Their Factors**

Prime numbers are special because they only have two factors: **1 and the number itself**. For example, the number 7 is a prime number because the only numbers that divide 7 evenly are 1 and 7. Understanding prime numbers helps us figure out how other numbers can be broken down into factors.

For example, the number 12 can be broken down into **prime factors**: 12 = 2 × 2 × 3. This is called the **prime factorization** of 12.

## **How Are Factors and Multiples Useful?**

1. **Finding Greatest Common Factors (GCF):**
   When working with two numbers, sometimes we need to find the largest factor that both numbers share. This is called the greatest common factor. For example, the factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. The factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. The largest factor they share is 6, so the GCF of 18 and 24 is 6.

2. **Finding Least Common Multiples (LCM):**
   When you are adding or subtracting fractions, or comparing numbers, it's useful to find the least common multiple. This is the smallest multiple that two numbers share. For example, the multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and so on. The multiples of 6 are 6, 12, 18, and so on. The smallest multiple that both 4 and 6 share is 12, so the least common multiple of 4 and 6 is 12.

## **Summary**

- **Factors** are the numbers that divide another number exactly.
- **Multiples** are the results of multiplying a number by whole numbers.
- Prime numbers have only two factors: 1 and the number itself.
- Understanding factors and multiples helps solve real-world problems, from dividing things into groups to finding the greatest common factor and least common multiple of numbers.
