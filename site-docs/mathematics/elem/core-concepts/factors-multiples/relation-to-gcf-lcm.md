# Relation of Factors & Multiples to GCF and LCM

Let’s explore examples of how factors and multiples relate to the GCF and LCM in more detail, and how they can be applied:

## Example 1: Finding Common Factors Using GCF

Let’s say \( a = 48 \) and \( b = 60 \).

### Step 1: Find GCF

To find the GCF, list the prime factorizations of both numbers:

- \( 48 = 2^4 \times 3 \)
- \( 60 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5 \)

The GCF is the product of the lowest powers of the common prime factors:

- \( \text{gcf}(48, 60) = 2^2 \times 3 = 12 \)

### Step 2: Use GCF to Identify Common Factors

Factors of 12 are \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 \), and these are the common factors of 48 and 60.

- **Common Factors of 48 and 60**: \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 \).

## Example 2: Finding Common Multiples Using LCM

Let’s use the same numbers, \( a = 48 \) and \( b = 60 \).

### Step 1: Find LCM

For the LCM, take the highest powers of all prime factors in the factorizations:

- \( 48 = 2^4 \times 3 \)
- \( 60 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5 \)

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes:

- \( \text{lcm}(48, 60) = 2^4 \times 3 \times 5 = 240 \)

### Step 2: Use LCM to Identify Common Multiples

The smallest common multiple of 48 and 60 is 240. All other common multiples will be multiples of 240 (e.g., 480, 720, 960, etc.).

- **Common Multiples of 48 and 60**: \( 240, 480, 720, 960, \ldots \).
