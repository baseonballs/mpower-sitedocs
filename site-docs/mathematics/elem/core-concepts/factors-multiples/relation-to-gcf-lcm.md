# Relation of Factors & Multiples to GCF and LCM

Let’s explore examples of how factors and multiples relate to the GCF and LCM in more detail, and how they can be applied:

## Example 1: Finding Common Factors Using GCF

Let’s say \( a = 48 \) and \( b = 60 \).

### Step 1: Find GCF

To find the GCF, list the prime factorizations of both numbers:

- \( 48 = 2^4 \times 3 \)
- \( 60 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5 \)

The GCF is the product of the lowest powers of the common prime factors:

- \( \text{gcf}(48, 60) = 2^2 \times 3 = 12 \)
