# Properties of Multiples

A **multiple** of a number is the result of multiplying that number by an integer. Understanding multiples helps with recognizing patterns, solving problems involving repetition or cycles, and finding common ground between numbers (like the least common multiple). Letâ€™s explore the core properties of multiples.

## **1. Definition of a Multiple**

A number \(b\) is a multiple of a number \(a\) if there exists an integer \(n\) such that:

\[
b = a \times n
\]

Here, \(a\) is a factor of \(b\), and \(b\) is a multiple of \(a\).

### Example:

For \(a = 3\), some multiples of 3 are \(3, 6, 9, 12, 15, \dots\) because these are obtained by multiplying 3 by integers.
