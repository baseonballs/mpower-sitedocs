# Exercise: Proportion vs Inproportional Relationship Solutions

## Exercise 1: **Identifying Proportional Relationships**

1. **Proportional**: The cost of buying multiple loaves of bread is proportional because if you double the number of loaves, you double the cost (e.g., 2 loaves cost $4, 3 loaves cost $6, etc.).
  
2. **Inversely Proportional**: The speed of a car and the time taken to travel a fixed distance are inversely proportional. If you increase the speed, the time decreases (e.g., driving faster means less time to cover the same distance).

3. **Proportional**: The length of a shadow is proportional to the height of the object casting it, assuming the light source remains constant. If the height doubles, the shadow length doubles.

4. **Inversely Proportional**: The time required to fill a swimming pool at a fixed capacity is inversely proportional to the rate of water flow. If the flow rate increases, the time to fill the pool decreases.

## Exercise 2: **Proportional Relationship Table**

Using the equation \( y = 3x \):

| \( x \) | \( y \) |
|--------|--------|
| 1      | 3      |
| 2      | 6      |
| 4      | 12     |
| 5      | 15     |
| 10     | 30     |

## Exercise 3: **Inversely Proportional Relationship Table**

Using the equation \( y = \frac{12}{x} \):

| \( x \) | \( y \) |
|--------|--------|
| 1      | 12     |
| 2      | 6      |
| 3      | 4      |
| 6      | 2      |
| 12     | 1      |

## Exercise 4: **Word Problem (Proportional Relationship)**
The equation representing the total cost \( C \) as a function of the number of days \( d \) is:

\[ C = 50d \]

To find the cost to rent the car for 7 days:

\[
C = 50 \times 7 = 350
\]

**Total Cost for 7 days: $350**

## Exercise 5: **Word Problem (Inversely Proportional Relationship)**
From the information given, if 5 people take 10 hours, we can express it as:

\[
T \times p = k \quad \text{(constant)}
\]

\[
10 \times 5 = k \Rightarrow k = 50
\]

Now, for 2 people:

\[
T \times 2 = 50 \Rightarrow T = \frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

**It would take 2 people 25 hours to complete the project.**
