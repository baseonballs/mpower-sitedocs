# Proportion vs Inproportional Relationship

A **proportional relationship** and an **inversely proportional relationship** describe how two quantities are related to each other:

## 1. **Proportional Relationship (Direct Proportion):**

In a proportional (or directly proportional) relationship, two quantities increase or decrease at the same rate. This means that as one quantity increases, the other increases by the same factor, and vice versa.

- **Mathematical Form:**

  If \( y \) is directly proportional to \( x \), we write:

\[
y = kx
\]

  where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

- **Example:**

  If you buy apples, the cost (\( y \)) is proportional to the number of apples (\( x \)) you buy. If the price of each apple is \( k \), the total cost is \( y = kx \).

- **Graphical Representation:**
  A graph of a proportional relationship is a straight line that passes through the origin (0, 0).
