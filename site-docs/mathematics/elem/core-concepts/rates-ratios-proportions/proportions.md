# Proportion vs Inproportional Relationship

A **proportional relationship** and an **inversely proportional relationship** describe how two quantities are related to each other:

## 1. **Proportional Relationship (Direct Proportion):**
In a proportional (or directly proportional) relationship, two quantities increase or decrease at the same rate. This means that as one quantity increases, the other increases by the same factor, and vice versa.

- **Mathematical Form:**

  If \( y \) is directly proportional to \( x \), we write:

\[
y = kx
\]

  where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

- **Example:**

  If you buy apples, the cost (\( y \)) is proportional to the number of apples (\( x \)) you buy. If the price of each apple is \( k \), the total cost is \( y = kx \).

- **Graphical Representation:**
  A graph of a proportional relationship is a straight line that passes through the origin (0, 0).

## 2. **Inversely Proportional Relationship (Inverse Proportion):**

In an inversely proportional relationship, as one quantity increases, the other decreases. This means that if one quantity is doubled, the other is halved, and so on.

- **Mathematical Form:**

  If \( y \) is inversely proportional to \( x \), we write:

\[
y = \frac{k}{x}
\]

  where \( k \) is a constant.

- **Example:**

  The time it takes to complete a task (\( y \)) is inversely proportional to the number of people (\( x \)) working on it. If more people work on the task, the time to finish decreases.

- **Graphical Representation:**

  A graph of an inverse relationship is a hyperbola, where one axis represents \( y \) and the other represents \( x \), and it curves toward the axes but never touches them.

---

**Summary:**

- **Proportional (Direct)**: As \( x \) increases, \( y \) increases (or decreases together).
- **Inversely Proportional**: As \( x \) increases, \( y \) decreases.
