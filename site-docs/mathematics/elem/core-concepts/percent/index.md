### Percent

**Introduction to Percent**

The term "percent" originates from the Latin phrase *per centum*, meaning "by the hundred." It is a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100, which allows for easier comparison between different quantities. Percentages are widely used in various fields, including finance, education, science, and everyday life, making them a crucial concept for understanding proportions and ratios.

**Basic Understanding of Percent**

A percentage is represented by the symbol “%.” For example, 25% means 25 out of every 100. To convert a percentage to a decimal, you divide by 100. Thus, 25% becomes 0.25 (i.e., 25 ÷ 100). Conversely, to convert a decimal back to a percentage, you multiply by 100; for example, 0.25 becomes 25%.

**Applications of Percent in Everyday Life**

1. **Finance**: Percentages are often used to describe interest rates, discounts, and profit margins. For instance, if an item originally costs $100 and is on sale for 20% off, the discount amount can be calculated as 20% of $100, which equals $20. Therefore, the sale price is $100 - $20 = $80.

2. **Statistics**: Percentages are vital in presenting data clearly. In surveys or studies, results are often expressed as percentages to provide a clearer understanding of proportions. For example, if 75 out of 100 people prefer a specific brand, it can be stated that 75% of respondents favor that brand.

3. **Education**: Percentages are commonly used in grading systems. A student who scores 90 out of 100 on a test has achieved 90%. This system helps to standardize evaluation and provides a straightforward way to compare academic performance.

4. **Health**: In the medical field, percentages are used to report on various health metrics. For example, body mass index (BMI) calculations and blood pressure readings often utilize percentages to indicate health status.
