# AoPS Algebra 2 - Problem Sets 4

## **Problem 1**

Problem Statement:

>Given that $(3,15)$ is on the graph of $y = f(x)$, find a point that must be on the graph of $y = f(x) - 7$. Express your answer as an ordered pair $(a,b)$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.

### Deconstruction & Analysis:

1. **Givens**:
   - The point \((3, 15)\) is on the graph of the function \( y = f(x) \).
   - You need to find a point on the graph of the new function \( y = f(x) - 7 \).

2. **Unknowns**:
   - The new \(y\)-coordinate for the given \(x = 3\) after the transformation is applied.

### Hints & Strategy Outline:

- **Hint 1**: Understand the effect of subtracting a constant from a function. What happens to the entire graph of \( f(x) \) when you subtract 7 from it?

- **Hint 2**: Consider the relationship between the point on the original function \( (3, 15) \) and how the new function \( y = f(x) - 7 \) modifies that \(y\)-coordinate.

- **Hint 3**: Use the given point \((3, 15)\) and adjust only the \(y\)-coordinate according to the transformation \( f(x) - 7 \). The \(x\)-coordinate remains unchanged.
