# AoPS Algebra 2 - Problem Sets 4

## **Problem 1**

Problem Statement:

>Given that $(3,15)$ is on the graph of $y = f(x)$, find a point that must be on the graph of $y = f(x) - 7$. Express your answer as an ordered pair $(a,b)$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.

### Deconstruction & Analysis:

1. **Givens**:
   - The point \((3, 15)\) is on the graph of the function \( y = f(x) \).
   - You need to find a point on the graph of the new function \( y = f(x) - 7 \).

2. **Unknowns**:
   - The new \(y\)-coordinate for the given \(x = 3\) after the transformation is applied.

### Hints & Strategy Outline:

- **Hint 1**: Understand the effect of subtracting a constant from a function. What happens to the entire graph of \( f(x) \) when you subtract 7 from it?

- **Hint 2**: Consider the relationship between the point on the original function \( (3, 15) \) and how the new function \( y = f(x) - 7 \) modifies that \(y\)-coordinate.

- **Hint 3**: Use the given point \((3, 15)\) and adjust only the \(y\)-coordinate according to the transformation \( f(x) - 7 \). The \(x\)-coordinate remains unchanged.


## **Problem 3**

Problem Statement:

>Given that $(2,-7)$ is on the graph of $y = f(x)$, find a point that must be on the graph of $y = f(x - 3)$. Express your answer as an ordered pair $(a,b)$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.

### Deconstruction & Analysis:

1. **Givens**:
   - The point \((2, -7)\) is on the graph of \(y = f(x)\).
   - You are asked to find a point on the graph of \(y = f(x - 3)\).

2. **Unknowns**:
   - The new \(x\)-coordinate after the transformation of the function, while the \(y\)-coordinate remains unchanged.

### Hints & Strategy Outline:

- **Hint 1**: Understand the effect of a horizontal shift on the graph of a function. What does subtracting 3 inside the function do to the \(x\)-coordinates of the points on the graph?

- **Hint 2**: For the given point \((2, -7)\), think about how the horizontal shift \(x - 3\) changes the original \(x\)-value. What new \(x\)-coordinate will result from this shift?

- **Hint 3**: The \(y\)-coordinate remains the same because the transformation only affects the \(x\)-coordinate. Use this to determine the new point.



## **Problem 4**

Problem Statement:

>Given that $(-2,3)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, find a point that must be on the graph of $y=f(2x+1)+3$. Express your answer as an ordered pair $(a,b)$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.


### Deconstruction & Analysis:

1. **Givens**:
   - The point \((-2, 3)\) is on the graph of \(y = f(x)\).
   - You need to find a point on the graph of the transformed function \(y = f(2x + 1) + 3\).

2. **Unknowns**:
   - The new \(x\)-coordinate after applying the transformation inside the function.
   - The new \(y\)-coordinate after considering both the transformation inside and the vertical shift outside the function.

### Hints & Strategy Outline:

- **Hint 1**: Start by understanding the inside transformation \(f(2x + 1)\). How does the \(2x + 1\) affect the \(x\)-coordinate of the original point? Consider solving for the original \(x\)-value that produces the same output in terms of \(f(x)\).

- **Hint 2**: The vertical transformation \(+3\) affects the \(y\)-coordinate. After calculating the new \(y\)-value for the modified input, adjust it by adding 3 to reflect the vertical shift.

- **Hint 3**: Use the original point \((-2, 3)\) to identify the required changes to both the \(x\)-coordinate (from the inside transformation) and the \(y\)-coordinate (from the outside transformation).

## **Problem 5**

>Let $f(x)$ be the function graphed below. Need the visualization of graph, and in terms of $f(x)$, what is the function graphed below?

## **Problem 6**

Problem Statement:

>The region between the graph of $y = f (x)$ and the $x$-axis, shaded in this figure, has an area of 10 square units. What is the area between the graph of $y = f (x +2)$ and the $x$-axis?

### Deconstruction & Analysis:

1. **Givens**:
   - The area between the graph of \(y = f(x)\) and the \(x\)-axis is 10 square units.
   - You need to determine the area between the graph of \(y = f(x + 2)\) and the \(x\)-axis.

2. **Unknowns**:
   - The area between \(y = f(x + 2)\) and the \(x\)-axis, and how the horizontal shift affects the area.

### Hints & Strategy Outline:

- **Hint 1**: Consider how a horizontal shift, such as \(f(x + 2)\), impacts the shape and position of the graph of \(f(x)\). Does it change the overall size of the area between the graph and the \(x\)-axis, or does it merely shift it left or right?

- **Hint 2**: Reflect on whether the transformation \(x + 2\) alters the actual integral (area) under the curve, or just the position of the curve itself along the \(x\)-axis.

- **Hint 3**: Use the fact that the total area under a function is preserved under horizontal shifts. What does this tell you about how the area for \(y = f(x + 2)\) compares to the original area of 10 square units?

## **Problem 7**

Problem Statement:

>The region between the graph of $y = f (x)$ and the $x$-axis, shaded in this figure, has an area of 10 square units. What is the area between the graph of $y = 6f (x - 6)$ and the $x$-axis?


### Deconstruction & Analysis:

1. **Givens**:
   - The area between the graph of \(y = f(x)\) and the \(x\)-axis is 10 square units.
   - You are asked to find the area between the graph of \(y = 6f(x - 6)\) and the \(x\)-axis.

2. **Unknowns**:
   - How the transformation \(6f(x - 6)\) affects the area between the graph and the \(x\)-axis.

### Hints & Strategy Outline:

- **Hint 1**: The transformation \(x - 6\) is a horizontal shift, which does not affect the area. Think about how the graph \(y = f(x)\) changes when shifted 6 units to the right.

- **Hint 2**: The factor of 6 outside the function scales the entire graph vertically by 6. Consider how this scaling affects the area under the curve. Does scaling the function by 6 multiply the area by 6 as well?

- **Hint 3**: Focus on the effect of vertical scaling on areas under a curve. The area of the region under the curve is proportional to the vertical scaling factor.

### Conclusion:
The horizontal shift \(x - 6\) does not affect the area, but the vertical scaling by 6 does. Since the original area is 10 square units, multiplying the graph by 6 multiplies the area by 6.

### Final Answer:
The area between the graph of \(y = 6f(x - 6)\) and the \(x\)-axis is \(10 \times 6 = 60\) square units.
