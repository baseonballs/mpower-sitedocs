# AoPS Algebra 2 - Problem Sets 4

## **Problem 1**

Problem Statement:

>Given that $(3,15)$ is on the graph of $y = f(x)$, find a point that must be on the graph of $y = f(x) - 7$. Express your answer as an ordered pair $(a,b)$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.

### Deconstruction & Analysis:

1. **Givens**:
   - The point \((3, 15)\) is on the graph of the function \( y = f(x) \).
   - You need to find a point on the graph of the new function \( y = f(x) - 7 \).

2. **Unknowns**:
   - The new \(y\)-coordinate for the given \(x = 3\) after the transformation is applied.

### Hints & Strategy Outline:

- **Hint 1**: Understand the effect of subtracting a constant from a function. What happens to the entire graph of \( f(x) \) when you subtract 7 from it?

- **Hint 2**: Consider the relationship between the point on the original function \( (3, 15) \) and how the new function \( y = f(x) - 7 \) modifies that \(y\)-coordinate.

- **Hint 3**: Use the given point \((3, 15)\) and adjust only the \(y\)-coordinate according to the transformation \( f(x) - 7 \). The \(x\)-coordinate remains unchanged.


## **Problem 3**

Problem Statement:

>Given that $(2,-7)$ is on the graph of $y = f(x)$, find a point that must be on the graph of $y = f(x - 3)$. Express your answer as an ordered pair $(a,b)$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.

### Deconstruction & Analysis:

1. **Givens**:
   - The point \((2, -7)\) is on the graph of \(y = f(x)\).
   - You are asked to find a point on the graph of \(y = f(x - 3)\).

2. **Unknowns**:
   - The new \(x\)-coordinate after the transformation of the function, while the \(y\)-coordinate remains unchanged.

### Hints & Strategy Outline:

- **Hint 1**: Understand the effect of a horizontal shift on the graph of a function. What does subtracting 3 inside the function do to the \(x\)-coordinates of the points on the graph?

- **Hint 2**: For the given point \((2, -7)\), think about how the horizontal shift \(x - 3\) changes the original \(x\)-value. What new \(x\)-coordinate will result from this shift?

- **Hint 3**: The \(y\)-coordinate remains the same because the transformation only affects the \(x\)-coordinate. Use this to determine the new point.



## **Problem 4**

Problem Statement:

>Given that $(-2,3)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, find a point that must be on the graph of $y=f(2x+1)+3$. Express your answer as an ordered pair $(a,b)$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.


### Deconstruction & Analysis:

1. **Givens**:
   - The point \((-2, 3)\) is on the graph of \(y = f(x)\).
   - You need to find a point on the graph of the transformed function \(y = f(2x + 1) + 3\).

2. **Unknowns**:
   - The new \(x\)-coordinate after applying the transformation inside the function.
   - The new \(y\)-coordinate after considering both the transformation inside and the vertical shift outside the function.

### Hints & Strategy Outline:

- **Hint 1**: Start by understanding the inside transformation \(f(2x + 1)\). How does the \(2x + 1\) affect the \(x\)-coordinate of the original point? Consider solving for the original \(x\)-value that produces the same output in terms of \(f(x)\).

- **Hint 2**: The vertical transformation \(+3\) affects the \(y\)-coordinate. After calculating the new \(y\)-value for the modified input, adjust it by adding 3 to reflect the vertical shift.

- **Hint 3**: Use the original point \((-2, 3)\) to identify the required changes to both the \(x\)-coordinate (from the inside transformation) and the \(y\)-coordinate (from the outside transformation).

## **Problem 5**

>Let $f(x)$ be the function graphed below. Need the visualization of graph, and in terms of $f(x)$, what is the function graphed below?

## **Problem 6**

Problem Statement:

>The region between the graph of $y = f (x)$ and the $x$-axis, shaded in this figure, has an area of 10 square units. What is the area between the graph of $y = f (x +2)$ and the $x$-axis?

### Deconstruction & Analysis:

1. **Givens**:
   - The area between the graph of \(y = f(x)\) and the \(x\)-axis is 10 square units.
   - You need to determine the area between the graph of \(y = f(x + 2)\) and the \(x\)-axis.

2. **Unknowns**:
   - The area between \(y = f(x + 2)\) and the \(x\)-axis, and how the horizontal shift affects the area.

### Hints & Strategy Outline:

- **Hint 1**: Consider how a horizontal shift, such as \(f(x + 2)\), impacts the shape and position of the graph of \(f(x)\). Does it change the overall size of the area between the graph and the \(x\)-axis, or does it merely shift it left or right?

- **Hint 2**: Reflect on whether the transformation \(x + 2\) alters the actual integral (area) under the curve, or just the position of the curve itself along the \(x\)-axis.

- **Hint 3**: Use the fact that the total area under a function is preserved under horizontal shifts. What does this tell you about how the area for \(y = f(x + 2)\) compares to the original area of 10 square units?

## **Problem 7**

Problem Statement:

>The region between the graph of $y = f (x)$ and the $x$-axis, shaded in this figure, has an area of 10 square units. What is the area between the graph of $y = 6f (x - 6)$ and the $x$-axis?


### Deconstruction & Analysis:

1. **Givens**:
   - The area between the graph of \(y = f(x)\) and the \(x\)-axis is 10 square units.
   - You are asked to find the area between the graph of \(y = 6f(x - 6)\) and the \(x\)-axis.

2. **Unknowns**:
   - How the transformation \(6f(x - 6)\) affects the area between the graph and the \(x\)-axis.

### Hints & Strategy Outline:

- **Hint 1**: The transformation \(x - 6\) is a horizontal shift, which does not affect the area. Think about how the graph \(y = f(x)\) changes when shifted 6 units to the right.

- **Hint 2**: The factor of 6 outside the function scales the entire graph vertically by 6. Consider how this scaling affects the area under the curve. Does scaling the function by 6 multiply the area by 6 as well?

- **Hint 3**: Focus on the effect of vertical scaling on areas under a curve. The area of the region under the curve is proportional to the vertical scaling factor.

### Conclusion:
The horizontal shift \(x - 6\) does not affect the area, but the vertical scaling by 6 does. Since the original area is 10 square units, multiplying the graph by 6 multiplies the area by 6.

### Final Answer:
The area between the graph of \(y = 6f(x - 6)\) and the \(x\)-axis is \(10 \times 6 = 60\) square units.


## **Problem 8**

Problem Statement:

>The region between the graph of $y = f (x)$ and the $x$-axis, shaded in this figure, has an area of 10 square units. What is the area between the graph of $y = \dfrac 12 f (-x)$ and the $x$-axis?

### Deconstruction & Analysis:

1. **Givens**:
   - The area between the graph of \(y = f(x)\) and the \(x\)-axis is 10 square units.
   - You need to find the area between the graph of \(y = \frac{1}{2} f(-x)\) and the \(x\)-axis.

2. **Unknowns**:
   - How the transformations \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(f(-x)\) affect the area.

### Hints & Strategy Outline:

- **Hint 1**: The transformation \(f(-x)\) reflects the graph across the \(y\)-axis. Consider whether this reflection affects the area under the curve.

- **Hint 2**: The factor of \(\frac{1}{2}\) scales the graph vertically. Think about how this scaling impacts the area under the curve. 

- **Hint 3**: The area of the region under a curve is proportional to the vertical scaling factor. If the original area is 10 square units, how will the area change when you multiply the function by \(\frac{1}{2}\)?

### Conclusion:
The reflection does not change the area, but the vertical scaling by \(\frac{1}{2}\) reduces the area.



## **Problem 9**

Problem Statement:

>When the graph of $y = 2x^2 - x + 7$ is shifted four units to the right, we obtain the graph of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$. Find $a + b + c$.


Let's deconstruct the problem step by step.

### Givens:
1. The original function is \( y = 2x^2 - x + 7 \).
2. The graph is shifted four units to the right.

### Unknowns:
1. The coefficients \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) of the new function \(y = ax^2 + bx + c\) after the shift.
2. The sum \(a + b + c\).

### Conditions/Constraints:
1. The transformation involves shifting the graph horizontally, which affects how the variable \(x\) is represented in the function.
2. The new function's form remains quadratic, \(y = ax^2 + bx + c\).

### Hints for Strategy:
1. **Understand the Transformation:** Focus on how a horizontal shift affects the function. Recall that shifting the graph right involves replacing \(x\) with \(x - h\), where \(h\) is the shift amount.
2. **Substitution:** Apply the transformation to the entire function, substituting \(x - 4\) into the original function.
3. **Expand and Simplify:** After substitution, ensure to expand and combine like terms carefully to express the new function in the standard quadratic form.
4. **Identify Coefficients:** Once you have the new function in the form \(y = ax^2 + bx + c\), clearly identify the coefficients \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
5. **Calculate the Sum:** Finally, compute the sum \(a + b + c\) using the identified coefficients.

By focusing on these elements, you can systematically approach the problem and arrive at the solution without rushing into calculations.


## **Problem 10*

Problem Statement:

>The function $f(x)$ is invertible, but the function $g(x)=f(kx)$ is not invertible. Find the sum of all possible values of $k$.

To analyze the problem, we start with the given functions and the conditions of invertibility.

### Givens:
1. The function \(f(x)\) is invertible. This means that \(f(x)\) is one-to-one, which implies it is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing over its domain.
2. The function \(g(x) = f(kx)\) is not invertible.

### Unknowns:
1. We need to find the sum of all possible values of \(k\) for which \(g(x)\) is not invertible.

### Conditions/Constraints:
1. A function is not invertible if it fails the horizontal line test, which occurs when it is not one-to-one.
2. For \(g(x) = f(kx)\) to be non-invertible, the composition \(f(kx)\) must have the same output for different inputs.

### Deconstruction:
1. **Function \(g(x)\):** The expression \(g(x) = f(kx)\) suggests that we are transforming the input to \(f\) by multiplying \(x\) by \(k\). 
2. **Behavior Based on \(k\):** 
   - If \(k = 0\), then \(g(x) = f(0)\) is a constant function (which is not invertible).
   - If \(k > 0\) or \(k < 0\), the behavior of \(g(x)\) depends on whether it stretches or compresses the input values into the domain of \(f\). 
3. **Analyzing Non-Invertibility:** 
   - The function \(g(x)\) could become non-invertible if \(kx\) takes on the same values for different \(x\). This can happen when \(k\) is such that it maps multiple \(x\) values to the same \(kx\) value. 

### Hints for Strategy:
1. **Investigate \(k\):** Start by setting up conditions under which \(kx_1 = kx_2\) for \(x_1 \neq x_2\). This typically occurs if \(k = 0\).
2. **Consider the cases:** Analyze the case for \(k > 0\) and \(k < 0\) to determine whether they can lead to non-invertibility. Focus on how the multiplication by \(k\) changes the input domain.
3. **Use derivative tests:** If \(f'(x) = 0\) at some point, \(f(kx)\) could also become non-invertible depending on \(k\) and where \(kx\) lands relative to the points where \(f'(x) = 0\).
4. **Summation of \(k\) values:** Once the values of \(k\) are identified, compute their sum.

By following these steps, you can systematically deduce the values of \(k\) for which \(g(x)\) is not invertible.
