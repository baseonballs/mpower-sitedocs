# AoPS Algebra 2 - Problem Sets 4 Solutions

## **Problem Set 1**

Problem Statement:

>Given that $(3,15)$ is on the graph of $y = f(x)$, find a point that must be on the graph of $y = f(x) - 7$. Express your answer as an ordered pair $(a,b)$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.


### **Analysis**

Let's break down the problem using the critical thinking framework:

    - Analysis - deconstruct the problems into simpler components. Identify context.
    - Evalulate - affirm the understing and validity (reasonableness) of info/data.
    - Inference - making connections between ideas or drawing the conclusion of data.


#### <span style="color: orange; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Identify the Givens</span>:

1. The point \((3, 15)\) is on the graph of \(y = f(x)\).
   - This means that when \(x = 3\), the function value \(f(3)\) equals 15. In equation form, \(f(3) = 15\).
   
2. We are asked to find a point on the graph of \(y = f(x) - 7\).
   - This is a transformation of the function \(f(x)\) where every output value of the function is decreased by 7.

#### <span style="color: orange; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Identify the Unknown</span>:
We need to find a point \((a, b)\) that lies on the graph of \(y = f(x) - 7\).

#### <span style="color: orange; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Strategy</span>:

1. **Start with the original function \(f(x)\):** We know that for \(x = 3\), \(f(3) = 15\).
   
2. **Apply the transformation to \(f(x)\):** The new function is \(y = f(x) - 7\), which means that for any given \(x\), the output will be \(f(x)\) decreased by 7. 

   Specifically, for \(x = 3\), the output will now be:
   \[
   f(3) - 7 = 15 - 7 = 8
   \]
   
3. **Form the new point:** The x-coordinate remains unchanged since the transformation affects only the output (y-value). Therefore, the point \((a, b)\) is \((3, 8)\).

#### <span style="color: brown; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Conclusion</span>:
The point that must be on the graph of \(y = f(x) - 7\) is \((3, 8)\).

#### <span style="color: brown; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Thinking and Deconstruction of the Problem</span>:
- **Givens:** The point \((3, 15)\) on the original graph, meaning \(f(3) = 15\).
- **Transformation:** The function \(f(x)\) is shifted down by 7 units, so \(y = f(x) - 7\).
- **Unknown solved:** The new point is \((3, 8)\), where the output is adjusted by the transformation.

This problem illustrates how function transformations impact the graph, specifically vertical shifts.

## **Problem 6**

The solution relies on understanding that a horizontal shift of a graph does not change the area under the curve, only its position along the \(x\)-axis.

Since the function \(y = f(x + 2)\) represents a horizontal shift of the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to the left by 2 units, the shape of the graph remains the same, and the area between the graph and the \(x\)-axis is unchanged.

### Final Answer:
The area between the graph of \(y = f(x + 2)\) and the \(x\)-axis is also **10 square units**, the same as the original area.

## **Problem 7**

Problem Statement:

>The region between the graph of $y = f (x)$ and the $x$-axis, shaded in this figure, has an area of 10 square units. What is the area between the graph of $y = 6f (x - 6)$ and the $x$-axis?

### Conclusion:
The horizontal shift \(x - 6\) does not affect the area, but the vertical scaling by 6 does. Since the original area is 10 square units, multiplying the graph by 6 multiplies the area by 6.

### Final Answer:
The area between the graph of \(y = 6f(x - 6)\) and the \(x\)-axis is \(10 \times 6 = 60\) square units.

## **Problem 8**

### Conclusion:
The reflection does not change the area, but the vertical scaling by \(\frac{1}{2}\) reduces the area.

### Final Answer:
The area between the graph of \(y = \frac{1}{2} f(-x)\) and the \(x\)-axis is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) square units.


## Problem 9

Problem Statment:
>When the graph of $y = 2x^2 - x + 7$ is shifted four units to the right, we obtain the graph of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$. Find $a + b + c$.

To find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) after shifting the graph of the function \(y = 2x^2 - x + 7\) four units to the right, we start by applying the transformation associated with the horizontal shift.

### Step 1: Understand the transformation

Shifting a graph to the right by \(h\) units can be accomplished by replacing \(x\) with \(x - h\) in the function. In this case, since we are shifting four units to the right, we replace \(x\) with \(x - 4\).

### Step 2: Substitute \(x - 4\) into the function

We substitute \(x - 4\) into the original function:

\[
y = 2(x - 4)^2 - (x - 4) + 7
\]

### Step 3: Expand the expression

Now we will expand the expression step-by-step:

1. **Calculate \((x - 4)^2\):**

\[
(x - 4)^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16
\]

2. **Substitute this into the equation:**

\[
y = 2(x^2 - 8x + 16) - (x - 4) + 7
\]

3. **Distribute the 2:**

\[
y = 2x^2 - 16x + 32 - (x - 4) + 7
\]

4. **Distribute the negative sign:**

\[
y = 2x^2 - 16x + 32 - x + 4 + 7
\]

5. **Combine like terms:**

\[
y = 2x^2 - 17x + 43
\]

### Step 4: Identify \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\)

From the final expression \(y = 2x^2 - 17x + 43\), we can identify the coefficients:

- \(a = 2\)
- \(b = -17\)
- \(c = 43\)

### Step 5: Calculate \(a + b + c\)

Now we compute \(a + b + c\):

\[
a + b + c = 2 - 17 + 43
\]

\[
= 2 + 43 - 17
\]

\[
= 45 - 17 = 28
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{28}
\]


## Problem 11

Problem Statement:
>When the graph of a certain function $f(x)$ is shifted $2$ units to the right and stretched vertically by a factor of $2$ relative to the $x$-axis (meaning that all $y$-coordinates are doubled), the resulting graph is identical to the original graph.

Given that $f(0)=1$, what is $f(10)$?

Let's analyze the given transformations step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the transformations

1. **Shifting the graph 2 units to the right:** This means that if \(y = f(x)\), the new function after the shift becomes:

\[
y = f(x - 2)
\]

2. **Stretching vertically by a factor of 2:** This transformation modifies the function to:

\[
y = 2f(x)
\]

### Step 2: Set up the equation

After applying both transformations, the resulting graph is identical to the original graph \(y = f(x)\). Thus, we have:

\[
f(x) = 2f(x - 2)
\]

### Step 3: Solve the functional equation

We need to express \(f(x)\) in a way that allows us to solve this equation. 

1. Start with the equation:

\[
f(x) = 2f(x - 2)
\]

2. Substitute \(x - 2\) into the equation:

\[
f(x - 2) = 2f(x - 4)
\]

   Substituting this back into the original equation gives:

\[
f(x) = 2(2f(x - 4)) = 4f(x - 4)
\]

3. We can continue this process:

\[
f(x) = 4f(x - 4) = 4(2f(x - 6)) = 8f(x - 6)
\]

Continuing this pattern, we can express \(f(x)\) in terms of \(f(x - 2n)\):

\[
f(x) = 2^n f(x - 2n)
\]

### Step 4: Find a pattern

Since this relationship holds for all \(n\), let's consider what happens as \(n\) increases. Eventually, as \(n\) becomes large enough, \(x - 2n\) will reach negative values. We know \(f(0) = 1\), so we need to find a specific \(n\) such that \(x - 2n = 0\).

Let's set \(x - 2n = 0\):

\[
x = 2n \implies n = \frac{x}{2}
\]

### Step 5: Substitute \(x = 10\)

Now, substituting \(x = 10\):

\[
n = \frac{10}{2} = 5
\]

So,

\[
f(10) = 2^5 f(10 - 10) = 32 f(0) = 32 \cdot 1 = 32
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the value of \(f(10)\) is:

\[
\boxed{32}
\]
