## **Problem 1**

### <span style="color: brown; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Problem Statement</span>:
>The point \( \overline{z} \) is shown below. What is \( z \)?
>
It includes a diagram where the point \( \overline{z} \) is located at (-2, 1) on the complex plane. The task is to determine the value of the complex number \( z \), given its conjugate \( \overline{z} \).

### Problem Deconstruction
The problem involves finding the complex number \( z \) when given its conjugate \( \overline{z} \). The given point \( \overline{z} \) is located at the coordinates (-2, 1) on the complex plane. 

### Givens
- The point \( \overline{z} \) is located at (-2, 1).
- In complex numbers, if \( z = a + bi \), then its conjugate \( \overline{z} = a - bi \).

### Unknowns
- The values of \( a \) and \( b \) in the expression \( z = a + bi \).
- The value of \( z \) itself.

### Constraints
- The solution must involve only elementary methods appropriate for Algebra 1 concepts, focusing on the relationship between a complex number and its conjugate.

### Hints for Strategy to Solve
1. **Identify Coordinates:** Recognize that the coordinates of \( \overline{z} \) correspond to the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.
2. **Understand Conjugate Relationship:** Use the definition of the complex conjugate to relate \( z \) and \( \overline{z} \).
3. **Formulate Equations:** Set up equations based on the real and imaginary components derived from the coordinates of \( \overline{z} \).
4. **Solve for Unknowns:** Use the equations to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that will give you \( z \).


## **Problem 2**

### <span style="color: brown; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Problem Statement</span>:
>Let \( z \) be a complex number satisfying the equation:
>
\[
2z + 3\overline{z} = - 25 - 2i.
\]
>
What is the value of \( z \)?

### Deconstruction:
The equation involves both the complex number \( z \) and its conjugate \( \overline{z} \). The goal is to find the value of \( z \), given the relationship between \( z \), \( \overline{z} \), and the complex number on the right-hand side of the equation.

### Givens:
- \( z \) is a complex number, represented as \( z = a + bi \), where \( a \) is the real part and \( b \) is the imaginary part.
- The conjugate of \( z \), denoted \( \overline{z} \), is \( \overline{z} = a - bi \).
- The equation is \( 2z + 3\overline{z} = -25 - 2i \).

### Unknowns:
- The real part \( a \) and the imaginary part \( b \) of the complex number \( z = a + bi \).
- The exact value of \( z \).

### Constraints:
- Use only elementary methods involving Algebra 1 concepts and the relationship between a complex number and its conjugate.

### Hints for Strategy to Solve:
1. **Substitute \( z \) and \( \overline{z} \):** Write \( z \) as \( a + bi \) and \( \overline{z} \) as \( a - bi \), then substitute them into the given equation.
2. **Separate Real and Imaginary Parts:** Simplify the resulting expression, isolating the real and imaginary components.
3. **Form a System of Equations:** This will yield two separate equationsâ€”one for the real part and one for the imaginary part. Solve this system to find \( a \) and \( b \).
4. **Solve for \( z \):** Once \( a \) and \( b \) are known, you can express the value of \( z \) as \( a + bi \).

## **Problem 3**

### <span style="color: brown; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Problem Statement</span>:
>Find the area of the region in the complex plane defined by \( |z| < 5 \), where \( z \) is a complex number.

### Deconstruction:
The expression \( |z| < 5 \) represents a region in the complex plane. The magnitude \( |z| \) of a complex number \( z = a + bi \) is given by \( |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \). This inequality defines a circular region in the complex plane, where the distance from the origin (0, 0) to any point \( z \) is less than 5.

### Givens:
- \( |z| < 5 \) defines the set of all points inside a circle with radius 5, centered at the origin of the complex plane.
- The region in question is a circle with radius 5.

### Unknowns:
- The area of the region inside the circle defined by \( |z| < 5 \).

### Constraints:
- The solution must involve basic geometric concepts related to the area of a circle.

### Hints for Strategy to Solve:
1. **Interpret the Magnitude Condition:** Recognize that \( |z| < 5 \) corresponds to a circle in the complex plane with radius 5.
2. **Use the Formula for the Area of a Circle:** The area \( A \) of a circle with radius \( r \) is given by \( A = \pi r^2 \).
3. **Substitute the Radius:** Plug the value \( r = 5 \) into the area formula to find the area of the region.
