## **Problem 1**

### <span style="color: brown; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Problem Statement</span>:
>The point \( \overline{z} \) is shown below. What is \( z \)?
>
It includes a diagram where the point \( \overline{z} \) is located at (-2, 1) on the complex plane. The task is to determine the value of the complex number \( z \), given its conjugate \( \overline{z} \).

### Problem Deconstruction
The problem involves finding the complex number \( z \) when given its conjugate \( \overline{z} \). The given point \( \overline{z} \) is located at the coordinates (-2, 1) on the complex plane. 

### Givens
- The point \( \overline{z} \) is located at (-2, 1).
- In complex numbers, if \( z = a + bi \), then its conjugate \( \overline{z} = a - bi \).

### Unknowns
- The values of \( a \) and \( b \) in the expression \( z = a + bi \).
- The value of \( z \) itself.

### Constraints

## **Problem 2**

### <span style="color: brown; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Problem Statement</span>:
>Let \( z \) be a complex number satisfying the equation:
>
\[
2z + 3\overline{z} = - 25 - 2i.
\]
>
What is the value of \( z \)?

### Deconstruction:
The equation involves both the complex number \( z \) and its conjugate \( \overline{z} \). The goal is to find the value of \( z \), given the relationship between \( z \), \( \overline{z} \), and the complex number on the right-hand side of the equation.

### Givens:
- \( z \) is a complex number, represented as \( z = a + bi \), where \( a \) is the real part and \( b \) is the imaginary part.
- The conjugate of \( z \), denoted \( \overline{z} \), is \( \overline{z} = a - bi \).
- The equation is \( 2z + 3\overline{z} = -25 - 2i \).

### Unknowns:
- The real part \( a \) and the imaginary part \( b \) of the complex number \( z = a + bi \).
- The exact value of \( z \).

### Constraints:
- Use only elementary methods involving Algebra 1 concepts and the relationship between a complex number and its conjugate.

### Hints for Strategy to Solve:
1. **Substitute \( z \) and \( \overline{z} \):** Write \( z \) as \( a + bi \) and \( \overline{z} \) as \( a - bi \), then substitute them into the given equation.
2. **Separate Real and Imaginary Parts:** Simplify the resulting expression, isolating the real and imaginary components.
3. **Form a System of Equations:** This will yield two separate equationsâ€”one for the real part and one for the imaginary part. Solve this system to find \( a \) and \( b \).
4. **Solve for \( z \):** Once \( a \) and \( b \) are known, you can express the value of \( z \) as \( a + bi \).

## **Problem 3**

### <span style="color: brown; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Problem Statement</span>:
>Find the area of the region in the complex plane defined by \( |z| < 5 \), where \( z \) is a complex number.

### Deconstruction:
The expression \( |z| < 5 \) represents a region in the complex plane. The magnitude \( |z| \) of a complex number \( z = a + bi \) is given by \( |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \). This inequality defines a circular region in the complex plane, where the distance from the origin (0, 0) to any point \( z \) is less than 5.

### Givens:
- \( |z| < 5 \) defines the set of all points inside a circle with radius 5, centered at the origin of the complex plane.
- The region in question is a circle with radius 5.

### Unknowns:
- The area of the region inside the circle defined by \( |z| < 5 \).

### Constraints:
- The solution must involve basic geometric concepts related to the area of a circle.

### Hints for Strategy to Solve:
1. **Interpret the Magnitude Condition:** Recognize that \( |z| < 5 \) corresponds to a circle in the complex plane with radius 5.
2. **Use the Formula for the Area of a Circle:** The area \( A \) of a circle with radius \( r \) is given by \( A = \pi r^2 \).
3. **Substitute the Radius:** Plug the value \( r = 5 \) into the area formula to find the area of the region.

## **Problem 4**

### <span style="color: brown; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Problem Statement</span>:
>Find a function \( f(z) \) such that the line shown below is the graph of the equation \( |z - 3i| = |f(z)| \).

### Deconstruction:
The problem requires finding a function \( f(z) \) that describes the relationship between the distance from the point \( z \) to \( 3i \) (the point on the imaginary axis at \( (0, 3) \)) and the distance from \( z \) to the graph of the red line, which has the equation \( y = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2} \).

### Givens:
- The equation \( |z - 3i| = |f(z)| \) involves the distance from a point \( z \) on the complex plane to the point \( 3i \).
- The red line represents the geometric locus where the distance from \( z \) to \( 3i \) equals the distance to some function \( f(z) \).
- The red line is given by the equation \( y = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2} \), which can be interpreted geometrically in the complex plane.

### Unknowns:
- The function \( f(z) \) that describes the distance relationship represented by the red line.

### Constraints:
- The function \( f(z) \) must be found such that the relationship \( |z - 3i| = |f(z)| \) holds for all points on the red line.

### Hints for Strategy to Solve:
1. **Interpret \( z \) Geometrically:** Let \( z = x + yi \), where \( x \) and \( y \) are the real and imaginary components of a complex number.
2. **Understand the Distance Condition:** The equation \( |z - 3i| = |f(z)| \) means the distance from \( z \) to \( 3i \) is equal to the distance to some point on the red line.
3. **Parameterize the Line:** The equation of the red line is \( y = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2} \), so for any point \( z = x + yi \), the point on the red line is related to the function.
4. **Derive the Function:** Analyze the geometry of the situation to deduce the correct form of \( f(z) \). Consider the relationship between the distances involved and use this to formulate \( f(z) \).

## **Problem 5**

### <span style="color: brown; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Problem Statement</span>:
>Evaluate the magnitude of the complex number \( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{3}{8}i \).

### Deconstruction:

### Givens:
- The complex number is \( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{3}{8}i \), where:
  - Real part \( a = \frac{1}{2} \)
  - Imaginary part \( b = -\frac{3}{8} \)

### Unknowns:

### Strategy Hints (Flow):
1. **Recognize the Complex Number Form:** Identify that the given complex number is \( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{3}{8}i \), with \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( b = -\frac{3}{8} \).
2. **Apply the Magnitude Formula:** Use the formula \( |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.
3. **Square the Real and Imaginary Parts:** Compute \( \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 \) and \( \left( -\frac{3}{8} \right)^2 \).
4. **Add the Squares:** Sum the results from squaring the real and imaginary components.
5. **Simplify and Take Square Root:** Simplify the sum of squares and take the square root to find the magnitude of the complex number.


## **Problem 6**

### <span style="color: brown; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Problem Statement</span>:
>Find the product of the magnitudes of the complex numbers \( 3 - 2i \) and \( 3 + 2i \), expressed as \( |3 - 2i| \cdot |3 + 2i| \).

### Deconstruction:
The task requires calculating the magnitudes of two complex numbers and then multiplying these magnitudes together. The magnitude (or modulus) of a complex number \( z = a + bi \) is given by the formula:
\[
|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
\]

### Givens:
- The complex numbers are \( 3 - 2i \) and \( 3 + 2i \).
- For \( 3 - 2i \):
  - Real part \( a = 3 \)
  - Imaginary part \( b = -2 \)
- For \( 3 + 2i \):
  - Real part \( a = 3 \)
  - Imaginary part \( b = 2 \)

### Unknowns:
- The magnitudes \( |3 - 2i| \) and \( |3 + 2i| \).

### Constraints:
- Use the standard formula for the modulus of complex numbers to find the magnitudes.

### Strategy Hints:
1. **Calculate the Magnitude of \( 3 - 2i \):**
   - Identify the real part \( a = 3 \) and the imaginary part \( b = -2 \).
   - Use the formula \( |3 - 2i| = \sqrt{3^2 + (-2)^2} \).
   
2. **Calculate the Magnitude of \( 3 + 2i \):**
   - Identify the real part \( a = 3 \) and the imaginary part \( b = 2 \).
   - Use the formula \( |3 + 2i| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} \).

3. **Multiply the Magnitudes:**
   - Use the results from the previous calculations to find the product: 
   \[
   |3 - 2i| \cdot |3 + 2i| = \sqrt{13} \cdot \sqrt{13} = 13.
   \]

### Final Result:
Thus, the value of \( |3 - 2i| \cdot |3 + 2i| \) is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]


## **Problem 7**

### <span style="color: brown; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Problem Statement</span>:
>Calculate the magnitude \( |(1 - i)^8| \).

### Deconstruction:
The problem requires finding the magnitude of the complex number \( (1 - i) \) raised to the power of 8. The magnitude of a complex number can be calculated using the property that \( |z^n| = |z|^n \).

### Givens:
- The complex number is \( 1 - i \).

### Unknowns:
- The magnitude \( |(1 - i)^8| \).

### Constraints:
- Use the properties of magnitudes and complex numbers to find the result.

### Strategy Hints (Flow):
1. **Calculate the Magnitude of \( 1 - i \):**
   - Identify the real part \( a = 1 \) and the imaginary part \( b = -1 \).
   - Use the formula \( |1 - i| = \sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} \).

2. **Raise the Magnitude to the 8th Power:**
   - Use the property \( |(1 - i)^8| = |1 - i|^8 \) to find the final result.

### Detailed Calculation Steps:
1. **Magnitude Calculation:**
   \[
   |1 - i| = \sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 1} = \sqrt{2}
   \]

2. **Raise to the 8th Power:**
   \[
   |(1 - i)^8| = |1 - i|^8 = (\sqrt{2})^8
   \]

3. **Simplify the Result:**
   \[
   (\sqrt{2})^8 = (2^{1/2})^8 = 2^{4} = 16
   \]

### Final Result:
Thus, the value that Ringo should have found is:
\[
\boxed{16}
