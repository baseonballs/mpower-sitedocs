# Trignometry Identities

Trigonometric identities are essential in mathematics, especially in solving problems involving angles and periodic functions. These identities relate the trigonometric functions — sine (\( \sin \)), cosine (\( \cos \)), tangent (\( \tan \)), and others — to each other, making it easier to simplify expressions, solve equations, and prove more complex results.

Here’s a structured breakdown of the most fundamental **trigonometric identities**:

---

## **1. Pythagorean Identities**
These identities come from the Pythagorean Theorem applied to a right triangle. The most famous identity is derived from the unit circle:

\[
\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1
\]

From this, we can derive two other important identities:

\[
1 + \tan^2 \theta = \sec^2 \theta
\]

\[
1 + \cot^2 \theta = \csc^2 \theta
\]

These identities are particularly useful in simplifying expressions and converting between different trigonometric functions.

---

## **2. Reciprocal Identities**
Each trigonometric function has a reciprocal function:

- \( \sin \theta = \frac{1}{\csc \theta} \)
- \( \cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sec \theta} \)
- \( \tan \theta = \frac{1}{\cot \theta} \)
- \( \csc \theta = \frac{1}{\sin \theta} \)
- \( \sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos \theta} \)
- \( \cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta} \)

Reciprocal identities are often used in simplifying trigonometric expressions or when solving trigonometric equations.

---

## **3. Co-Function Identities**
Co-function identities express the relationship between trigonometric functions of complementary angles (\( 90^\circ - \theta \) or \( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \)):

\[
\sin\left(90^\circ - \theta\right) = \cos \theta
\]

\[
\cos\left(90^\circ - \theta\right) = \sin \theta
\]

\[
\tan\left(90^\circ - \theta\right) = \cot \theta
\]

\[
\cot\left(90^\circ - \theta\right) = \tan \theta
\]

\[
\sec\left(90^\circ - \theta\right) = \csc \theta
\]

\[
\csc\left(90^\circ - \theta\right) = \sec \theta
\]

These identities are particularly helpful when solving problems involving complementary angles, such as in right triangles or geometry problems.

---

## **4. Even-Odd Identities**
These identities show the symmetry properties of the trigonometric functions. Even functions are symmetric about the y-axis, while odd functions are symmetric about the origin:

- \( \sin(-\theta) = -\sin \theta \) (odd)
- \( \cos(-\theta) = \cos \theta \) (even)
- \( \tan(-\theta) = -\tan \theta \) (odd)
- \( \csc(-\theta) = -\csc \theta \) (odd)
- \( \sec(-\theta) = \sec \theta \) (even)
- \( \cot(-\theta) = -\cot \theta \) (odd)

These identities are useful when simplifying expressions involving negative angles or when analyzing symmetry in graphs of trigonometric functions.

---

## **5. Sum and Difference Identities**
These identities allow you to find the sine, cosine, or tangent of the sum or difference of two angles:

- **Sine:**
\[
\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

\[
\sin(\alpha - \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

- **Cosine:**
\[
\cos(\alpha + \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta
\]

\[
\cos(\alpha - \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \alpha \sin \beta
\]

- **Tangent:**
\[
\tan(\alpha + \beta) = \frac{\tan \alpha + \tan \beta}{1 - \tan \alpha \tan \beta}
\]

\[
\tan(\alpha - \beta) = \frac{\tan \alpha - \tan \beta}{1 + \tan \alpha \tan \beta}
\]

These identities are invaluable in solving trigonometric equations, proving identities, and finding exact values of trigonometric functions for sums or differences of special angles.

---

## **6. Double Angle Identities**
These identities express the trigonometric functions of double angles (\( 2\theta \)) in terms of the original angle:

- **Sine:**

\[
\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta
\]

- **Cosine:**

\[
\cos(2\theta) = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta = 2 \cos^2 \theta - 1 = 1 - 2 \sin^2 \theta
\]

- **Tangent:**

\[
\tan(2\theta) = \frac{2 \tan \theta}{1 - \tan^2 \theta}
\]

Double angle identities simplify problems where angles are doubled and are used extensively in calculus, particularly in integration and differentiation involving trigonometric functions.

---

## **7. Half Angle Identities**
These are derived from the double angle identities and help in finding the values of trigonometric functions of half-angles (\( \frac{\theta}{2} \)):

- **Sine:**

\[
\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{2}}
\]

- **Cosine:**

\[
\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos \theta}{2}}
\]

- **Tangent:**

\[
\tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{1 + \cos \theta}} = \frac{\sin \theta}{1 + \cos \theta}
\]

Half angle identities are useful in simplifying integrals and solving equations where the angle is halved, particularly in calculus.

---

## **8. Product-to-Sum and Sum-to-Product Identities**
These identities convert products of trigonometric functions into sums or differences, and vice versa:

- **Product-to-Sum:**

\[
\sin \alpha \sin \beta = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(\alpha - \beta) - \cos(\alpha + \beta)]
\]

\[
\cos \alpha \cos \beta = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(\alpha - \beta) + \cos(\alpha + \beta)]
\]

\[
\sin \alpha \cos \beta = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(\alpha + \beta) + \sin(\alpha - \beta)]
\]

- **Sum-to-Product:**

\[
\sin \alpha + \sin \beta = 2 \sin\left(\frac{\alpha + \beta}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{\alpha - \beta}{2}\right)
\]

\[
\cos \alpha + \cos \beta = 2 \cos\left(\frac{\alpha + \beta}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{\alpha - \beta}{2}\right)
\]

These identities are particularly useful in solving integrals and simplifying complex trigonometric expressions.
