# **Cartesian Plane**

The Cartesian plane, named after the French mathematician René Descartes, is a fundamental concept in mathematics, particularly in geometry and algebra. Here’s a detailed discourse on its key aspects:

## 1. Definition

The Cartesian plane is a two-dimensional coordinate system formed by the intersection of two perpendicular axes: the **x-axis** (horizontal) and the **y-axis** (vertical). It allows for the representation of points, lines, and geometric shapes using ordered pairs of real numbers.

## 2. Structure

1. **Axes**:
    - The **x-axis** is typically horizontal, representing the independent variable in functions.
    - The **y-axis** is vertical, representing the dependent variable.

2. **Origin**: 
    - The point where the x-axis and y-axis intersect is called the **origin**, designated as \((0, 0)\).

3. **Quadrants**:
    - The Cartesian plane is divided into four quadrants based on the signs of the coordinates:
        - **Quadrant I**: \((+,+)\)
        - **Quadrant II**: \((- ,+)\)
        - **Quadrant III**: \((-,-)\)
        - **Quadrant IV**: \((+,-)\)
