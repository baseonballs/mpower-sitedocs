# Cartesian Plane vs Euclidean Plane

## Cartesian Plane

- **Definition**: The Cartesian plane is a two-dimensional coordinate system defined by two perpendicular axes: the x-axis (horizontal) and the y-axis (vertical). It allows for the representation of points using ordered pairs \((x, y)\).
- **Coordinate System**: Points are identified by their distances from the two axes, facilitating algebraic operations and graphing.
- **Grid Structure**: The Cartesian plane has a grid structure, which allows for easy visualization of mathematical functions and relationships between points.
- **Applications**: It is widely used in algebra, calculus, and computer graphics for representing and manipulating geometric shapes and functions.
