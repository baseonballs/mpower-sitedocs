# Did You Know?

You landed here, because you are curious. Curious students and folks tend to be much smarter than the rest ðŸ˜„.

## Numbers:
1. <span style="color: orange; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Did you know?</span> <span style="color: blue; font-weight:normal; font-style: italic">The number 1 is the only number that cannot be made by adding or multiplying any other whole numbers together. Itâ€™s a unique number in the world of math!</span> 

**Explaination**

>The number 1 is unique because you can't create it by adding or multiplying any other whole numbers (other than 1 itself) together. 
>
>For example:
>
>1. **Adding Whole Numbers:**
>   - If you try to add whole numbers to get 1, you will see that you cannot achieve this with any combination other than using the number 1 itself. For instance, \(0 + 1 = 1\), but 0 is not a positive whole number.
>
>2. **Multiplying Whole Numbers:**
>   - When you multiply whole numbers, you always get results larger than 1, or 0 if you multiply by 0. For instance, \(2 \times 2 = 4\), and \(3 \times 3 = 9\). None of these products is 1.
>
>The only way to get the number 1 using multiplication is \(1 \times 1\), but this does not involve combining different whole numbersâ€”it just uses the same number.
>Thus, 1 stands alone as a unique number in this sense.

2. <span style="color: orange; font-weight:bold; font-style: normal">Did you know?</span> <span style="color: blue; font-weight:normal; font-style: italic">If you add up all the numbers from 1 to 100, you get 5050. This is thanks to a clever young mathematician named Carl Friedrich Gauss who figured this out when he was just 8 years old!</span> 

>**Explaination**
>
>1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - You want to find the sum of all whole numbers from 1 up to 100.
>
>2. **Using Gauss's Formula:**
>   - Gauss's method involves pairing numbers. For instance, if you list the numbers from 1 to 100 forward and backward:
     ```
     1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 100
     100 + 99 + 98 + ... + 1
     ```
   - Each pair (1 + 100, 2 + 99, 3 + 98, etc.) adds up to 101. There are 50 such pairs.
>
>3. **Formula Approach:**
>   - The formula Gauss used for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2}
\]
>   - Here, \( n \) is 100.
>
>4. **Calculate Using the Formula:**
>   - Plug \( n = 100 \) into the formula:
>

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{100 \times 101}{2} = \frac{10100}{2} = 5050
\]

>So, the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 is indeed 5050, thanks to Gauss's clever method!

3. **Did you know?** There are infinitely many prime numbers! A prime number is a number greater than 1 that can only be divided by 1 and itself. The number 2 is the only even prime number!

## Shapes:
1. **Did you know?** The simplest shape with straight sides is a triangle. It has just three sides, but it can make so many different kinds of triangles, like equilateral, isosceles, and scalene!

2. **Did you know?** If you cut a square in half diagonally, you get two right triangles. These triangles are special because they have a right angle (90 degrees) in them.

3. **Did you know?** A hexagon (a shape with six sides) can perfectly fit together without leaving any gaps, just like the tiles on a honeybeeâ€™s hive. 

## Basic Geometry:
1. **Did you know?** A circle is special because it doesnâ€™t have any corners or edges. Every point on the edge of a circle is the same distance from the center!

2. **Did you know?** The sum of the angles inside any triangle is always 180 degrees. No matter how you shape the triangle, this will always be true!

3. **Did you know?** If you draw two straight lines on a piece of paper, and they cross each other, the angles where they cross add up to 180 degrees. This is called a linear pair!

These facts can make math feel like a fascinating adventure and show how numbers and shapes are all around us in exciting ways!
