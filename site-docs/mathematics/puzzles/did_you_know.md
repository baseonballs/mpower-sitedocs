# Did You Know?

You landed here, because you are curious. Curious students and folks tend to be much smarter than the rest.

## Numbers:
1. **Did you know?** The number 1 is the only number that cannot be made by adding or multiplying any other whole numbers together. It’s a unique number in the world of math!

2. **Did you know?** If you add up all the numbers from 1 to 100, you get 5050. This is thanks to a clever mathematician named Carl Friedrich Gauss who figured this out when he was just 8 years old!

3. **Did you know?** There are infinitely many prime numbers! A prime number is a number greater than 1 that can only be divided by 1 and itself. The number 2 is the only even prime number!

## Shapes:
1. **Did you know?** The simplest shape with straight sides is a triangle. It has just three sides, but it can make so many different kinds of triangles, like equilateral, isosceles, and scalene!

2. **Did you know?** If you cut a square in half diagonally, you get two right triangles. These triangles are special because they have a right angle (90 degrees) in them.

3. **Did you know?** A hexagon (a shape with six sides) can perfectly fit together without leaving any gaps, just like the tiles on a honeybee’s hive. 

## Basic Geometry:
1. **Did you know?** A circle is special because it doesn’t have any corners or edges. Every point on the edge of a circle is the same distance from the center!

2. **Did you know?** The sum of the angles inside any triangle is always 180 degrees. No matter how you shape the triangle, this will always be true!

3. **Did you know?** If you draw two straight lines on a piece of paper, and they cross each other, the angles where they cross add up to 180 degrees. This is called a linear pair!

These facts can make math feel like a fascinating adventure and show how numbers and shapes are all around us in exciting ways!
