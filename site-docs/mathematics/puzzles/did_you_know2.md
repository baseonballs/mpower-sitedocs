# Did you know...?

### Number Sense / Numbers:
1. **Did you know?** If you add all the digits of the number 123 (1 + 2 + 3), you get 6. This is called the sum of the digits. Can you find the sum of the digits for the number 456?

2. **Did you know?** Multiplying any number by 9 always results in a number where the sum of the digits is 9. For example, 9 Ã— 4 = 36, and 3 + 6 = 9. Can you find another example?

3. **Did you know?** The number 0 is unique because it represents nothing but is crucial in mathematics. Can you think of a situation where 0 is very important in real life?

4. **Did you know?** A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward, like 121. Can you find a palindromic number between 100 and 200?

### Context from Number Theories:
5. **Did you know?** The ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras is famous for the Pythagorean theorem, which relates the sides of a right triangle. What is the Pythagorean theorem formula?

6. **Did you know?** Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that can only be divided by 1 and themselves. What are the first five prime numbers?

7. **Did you know?** The number 2 is the smallest and only even prime number. Can you find the next smallest prime number greater than 2?

8. **Did you know?** Mathematician Euclid wrote a book called "Elements" that included many important math discoveries. Can you name one geometric shape or property that Euclid studied?

### Discovery and Derivation of Formulas:
9. **Did you know?** The famous mathematician Gauss discovered a quick way to add numbers in a sequence. For example, if you add numbers from 1 to 100, you get 5050. Can you use Gauss's method to find the sum of numbers from 1 to 10?

10. **Did you know?** The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width. If a rectangle has a length of 5 units and a width of 4 units, what is its area?

11. **Did you know?** Archimedes, a great ancient mathematician, discovered how to find the area of a circle using the formula \( A = \pi r^2 \). If a circle has a radius of 3 units, what is its area?

12. **Did you know?** The formula for the volume of a cube is \( V = s^3 \), where \( s \) is the length of a side. If a cube has a side length of 2 units, what is its volume?

13. **Did you know?** The formula for the area of a triangle is \( A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \). If a triangle has a base of 6 units and a height of 4 units, what is its area?

### Shapes / Geometry:
14. **Did you know?** The angles in a straight line add up to 180 degrees. If you have one angle of 90 degrees, what is the measure of the other angle on the same line?

15. **Did you know?** A pentagon has five sides. Can you draw a pentagon and count how many angles it has?

16. **Did you know?** The sum of the interior angles of a hexagon (a six-sided shape) is always 720 degrees. Can you find out the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral (a four-sided shape)?

17. **Did you know?** A right angle is exactly 90 degrees. Can you identify a right angle in your classroom or home?

18. **Did you know?** The volume of a cylinder is found using the formula \( V = \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. If a cylinder has a radius of 2 units and a height of 5 units, what is its volume?

These questions should help engage students with fascinating math concepts and historical discoveries while developing their problem-solving skills!
