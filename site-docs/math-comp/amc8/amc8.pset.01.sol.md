# AMC 8 Problem Solutions

### **1. Problem: Age Puzzle - Solution**

>Corinne’s age is \(3\) times as old as her brother, Zander. In \(4\) years, Corinne’s age will be twice Zander’s age. How old is Corinne now?

**Solution:**
Let \( m \) be Corinne’s current age and \( b \) be her Zander's current age. We are given two pieces of information:

- \( m = 3b \) (Corinne is 3 times as old as her brother).
- \( m + 4 = 2(b + 4) \) (In 4 years, Corinne’s age will be twice her brother’s).

Substitute \( m = 3b \) into the second equation:

\[
3b + 4 = 2(b + 4)
\]

Expand and simplify:

\[
3b + 4 = 2b + 8
\]

\[
3b - 2b = 8 - 4
\]

\[
b = 4
\]

Since \( m = 3b \), Maria’s current age is:

\[
m = 3 \times 4 = 12
\]

Thus, Maria is \( \boxed{12} \) years old.

### **2. Problem: Sum of Angles - Solution**

>A triangle has angles that measure \( 40^\circ \), \( 60^\circ \), and \( x^\circ \). What is the value of \( x \)?

**Solution:**
The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always \( 180^\circ \). So we can set up the equation:

\[
40^\circ + 60^\circ + x^\circ = 180^\circ
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
100^\circ + x^\circ = 180^\circ
\]

\[
x^\circ = 180^\circ - 100^\circ = 80^\circ
\]

Thus, \( x = \boxed{80^\circ} \).

### **3. Problem: Number of Rectangles - Solution**

>How many rectangles are in a grid that is \( 3 \times 2 \) (3 rows and 2 columns)?

**Solution:**
To count the number of rectangles, note that a rectangle is determined by selecting two horizontal lines and two vertical lines. In a \( 3 \times 2 \) grid, there are \( 4 \) horizontal lines (top and bottom of each row) and \( 3 \) vertical lines (left and right of each column).

The number of ways to choose two horizontal lines from the \( 4 \) available is:

\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2} = 6
\]

The number of ways to choose two vertical lines from the \( 3 \) available is:

\[
\binom{3}{2} = \frac{3 \times 2}{2} = 3
\]

Thus, the total number of rectangles is:

\[
6 \times 3 = 18
\]

So, there are \( \boxed{18} \) rectangles in the grid.

### **4. Problem: Divisibility - Solution**

>What is the smallest integer divisible by \( 5 \), \( 6 \), and \( 7 \)?

**Solution:**
To find the smallest integer divisible by \( 5 \), \( 6 \), and \( 7 \), we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers.

First, find the prime factorizations of the numbers:

- \( 5 \) is prime.
- \( 6 = 2 \times 3 \)
- \( 7 \) is prime.

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors:

\[
\text{LCM}(5, 6, 7) = 2^1 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \times 7^1 = 210
\]

Thus, the smallest integer divisible by \( 5 \), \( 6 \), and \( 7 \) is \( \boxed{210} \).

### **5. Problem: Probability with Dice - Solution**

>Two six-sided dice are rolled. What is the probability that the sum of the numbers rolled is \( 7 \)?

**Solution:**
There are a total of \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) possible outcomes when rolling two dice (since each die has 6 faces). Now, list the outcomes where the sum of the dice is \( 7 \):

\[
(1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1)
\]

There are \( 6 \) outcomes where the sum is \( 7 \). Therefore, the probability is:

\[
\frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}
\]

So, the probability that the sum is \( 7 \) is \( \boxed{\frac{1}{6}} \).

---

### **6. Problem: Arithmetic Sequence - Solution**

> The first term of an arithmetic sequence is \( 3 \), and the fifth term is \( 19 \). What is the common difference of the sequence?

**Solution:**
In an arithmetic sequence, each term is given by:

\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
\]

where \( a_n \) is the \( n \)-th term, \( a_1 \) is the first term, and \( d \) is the common difference.

We know:

- \( a_1 = 3 \)
- \( a_5 = 19 \)

Substitute \( n = 5 \) into the formula for the fifth term:

\[
a_5 = a_1 + (5-1)d = 19
\]

\[
3 + 4d = 19
\]

\[
4d = 16
\]

\[
d = 4
\]

Thus, the common difference is \( \boxed{4} \).
