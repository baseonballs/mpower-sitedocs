# AMC 10 Problem Solutions

### **1. Problem: Simple Algebra - Solutions**

>What is the value of \( x \) if \( 3x + 7 = 19 \)?

**Solution:**

\[
3x + 7 = 19 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3x = 19 - 7 = 12 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{12}{3} = 4
\]

Thus, \( x = \boxed{4} \).

---

### **2. Problem: Geometry of a Triangle - Solutions**

>The perimeter of an equilateral triangle is \( 24 \). What is the length of one side?

**Solution:**
The perimeter of an equilateral triangle is \( 3s \), where \( s \) is the side length. Given that the perimeter is \( 24 \):

\[
3s = 24 \quad \Rightarrow \quad s = \frac{24}{3} = 8
\]

Thus, the length of one side is \( \boxed{8} \).

---

### **3. Problem: Percentage Increase - Solutions**

>A store originally sells a product for \( 40 \) dollars. The price is increased by \( 20\% \). What is the new price?

**Solution:**
The increase is \( 20\% \) of \( 40 \), which is:

\[
0.20 \times 40 = 8
\]

Thus, the new price is:
\[
40 + 8 = 48
\]

The new price is \( \boxed{48} \) dollars.

---

### **4. Problem: Factors - Solutions**

>How many positive divisors does \( 60 \) have?

**Solution:**
The prime factorization of \( 60 \) is:

\[
60 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5
\]

The number of divisors is given by \( (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 3 \times 2 \times 2 = 12 \).
Thus, \( 60 \) has \( \boxed{12} \) divisors.

---

### **5. Problem: Time Problem - Solutions**

>A clock shows \( 4:30 \). What is the measure of the smaller angle between the hour and minute hands?

**Solution:**
The minute hand at 30 minutes is \( 180^\circ \) from the 12 o'clock position. The hour hand at 4:30 is halfway between the 4 and 5 positions. Since each hour represents \( 30^\circ \), the hour hand is \( 4 \times 30 + 15 = 135^\circ \) from the 12 o'clock position.

The difference between the hands is:

\[
180^\circ - 135^\circ = 45^\circ
\]

Thus, the smaller angle is \( \boxed{45^\circ} \).

---

### **6. Problem: Consecutive Integers - Solutions**

>The sum of three consecutive integers is \( 33 \). What are the integers?

**Solution:**
Let the integers be \( x-1 \), \( x \), and \( x+1 \). Their sum is:

\[
(x-1) + x + (x+1) = 3x = 33 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{33}{3} = 11
\]

Thus, the integers are \( 10, 11, 12 \), and the answer is \( \boxed{10, 11, 12} \).

---

### **7. Problem: Arithmetic Sequence - Solutions**
In an arithmetic sequence, the first term is \( 5 \), and the common difference is \( 3 \). What is the sum of the first 20 terms?

**Solution:**
The sum of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is:

\[
S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a_1 + a_n)
\]

The 20th term is \( a_{20} = a_1 + 19d = 5 + 19 \times 3 = 62 \). Thus, the sum is:

\[
S_{20} = \frac{20}{2} \times (5 + 62) = 10 \times 67 = 670
\]

Thus, the sum of the first 20 terms is \( \boxed{670} \).

---

### **8. Problem: Probability - Solutions**

>Two dice are rolled. What is the probability that the sum of the numbers rolled is \( 8 \)?

**Solution:**
There are \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) possible outcomes. The combinations that sum to \( 8 \) are:

\[
(2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), (6,2)
\]

There are 5 favorable outcomes, so the probability is:

\[
\frac{5}{36}
\]

Thus, the probability is \( \boxed{\frac{5}{36}} \).

---

### **9. Problem: Quadratic Equation - Solutions**

>Solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \).

**Solution:**
Factor the quadratic:

\[
x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0
\]

Thus, \( x = 2 \) or \( x = 3 \).
The solutions are \( \boxed{2} \) and \( \boxed{3} \).

---

### **10. Problem: Right Triangle - Solutions**

>In a right triangle, the legs are \( 6 \) and \( 8 \). What is the length of the hypotenuse?

**Solution:**
Using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
c = \sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{36 + 64} = \sqrt{100} = 10
\]

Thus, the hypotenuse is \( \boxed{10} \).

---

### **11. Problem: Circles and Geometry - Solutions**

>Two concentric circles have radii of \( 3 \) and \( 5 \). What is the area of the ring-shaped region between the two circles?

**Solution:**
The area of the ring is the difference between the areas of the larger and smaller circles:

\[
\text{Area} = \pi \times 5^2 - \p
i \times 3^2 = 25\pi - 9\pi = 16\pi
\]
Thus, the area of the ring is \( \boxed{16\pi} \).

---

### **12. Problem: Sum of Angles in a Polygon - Solutions**

>What is the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon?

**Solution:**
The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides is given by:

\[
\text{Sum of angles} = 180(n-2)
\]

For a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)):

\[
\text{Sum of angles} = 180(5-2) = 180 \times 3 = 540
\]

Thus, the sum of the interior angles is \( \boxed{540^\circ} \).
