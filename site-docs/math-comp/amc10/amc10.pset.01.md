# AMC 10 Problem Sets 1

> The AMC 10 (American Mathematics Competition 10) is a prestigious math competition in the United States aimed at high school students in grade 10 or below who are 17.5 years old or younger. It is part of a series of competitions organized by the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) that encourage problem-solving skills and mathematical creativity. The AMC series progresses to higher levels, including the AMC 12, AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Examination), and ultimately the USAMO (United States of America Mathematical Olympiad).


Here are 12 problems typical of the **AMC 10** competition, which is aimed at high school students. The problems are arranged by increasing difficulty:

---

### **1. Problem: Simple Algebra**
What is the value of \( x \) if \( 3x + 7 = 19 \)?

### **2. Problem: Geometry of a Triangle**
The perimeter of an equilateral triangle is \( 24 \). What is the length of one side?


### **3. Problem: Percentage Increase**
A store originally sells a product for \( 40 \) dollars. The price is increased by \( 20\% \). What is the new price?


### **4. Problem: Factors**
How many positive divisors does \( 60 \) have?


### **5. Problem: Time Problem**
A clock shows \( 4:30 \). What is the measure of the smaller angle between the hour and minute hands?


### **6. Problem: Consecutive Integers**
The sum of three consecutive integers is \( 33 \). What are the integers?


### **7. Problem: Arithmetic Sequence**
In an arithmetic sequence, the first term is \( 5 \), and the common difference is \( 3 \). What is the sum of the first 20 terms?


### **8. Problem: Probability**
Two dice are rolled. What is the probability that the sum of the numbers rolled is \( 8 \)?


### **9. Problem: Quadratic Equation**
Solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \).


### **10. Problem: Right Triangle**
In a right triangle, the legs are \( 6 \) and \( 8 \). What is the length of the hypotenuse?


### **11. Problem: Circles and Geometry**
Two concentric circles have radii of \( 3 \) and \( 5 \). What is the area of the ring-shaped region between the two circles?


### **12. Problem: Sum of Angles in a Polygon**
What is the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon?
