# The Jealous Husband Puzzle

---

**The Puzzle:**

Three men and their wives must cross a river using a boat. The boat can only carry two people at a time, but there’s a catch:
- None of the men can be left with another man’s wife unless his own wife is present (the men are jealous and won’t allow it).
- The boat must be rowed back and forth to get everyone across safely.

**Question:**  
How can all six people (the three men and their three wives) safely cross the river, following the rules?

**Hint:**  
The trick is to carefully plan who goes in the boat on each trip, making sure no woman is left alone with another man without her husband.
