**The Counterfeit Coin Puzzle**

You have 12 coins, and all of them are identical in appearance except one, which is counterfeit. The counterfeit coin is either **lighter** or **heavier** than the rest. You have a balance scale that allows you to compare the weight of two groups of coins, but you can only use the scale **three times**.

**Question:**  
How can you determine which coin is the counterfeit, and whether it is heavier or lighter, in just three weighings?

**Hint:**  
You’ll need to divide the coins into groups and use the process of elimination to narrow down both the counterfeit coin and whether it’s heavier or lighter.
