**The Turtle and the Hare Puzzle**

The hare boasts that he can beat the turtle in a race. The turtle, tired of the hare’s bragging, proposes a race with a twist. The hare agrees, confident that he can win easily. The race starts, and the hare, as expected, quickly pulls ahead and decides to take a nap. The turtle continues at a steady pace and eventually passes the sleeping hare. When the hare wakes up, he tries to catch up, but the turtle crosses the finish line first.

**Question:**  
Explain why the turtle won the race, even though the hare was faster, using logical reasoning.
