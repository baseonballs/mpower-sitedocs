**The Fruit Basket Puzzle**

>Problem Statement: You have 3 baskets of fruit, but the labels on the baskets are all wrong:
>
- One basket is labeled "Apples."
- Another is labeled "Oranges."
- The last one is labeled "Apples and Oranges."

You know that each basket is mislabeled, meaning no basket contains the fruit or combination of fruits indicated by its label. You are allowed to reach into one basket and pull out one piece of fruit. 

**Question:**

How can you figure out whatâ€™s in each basket by only pulling out one fruit?

---

**Hint:**

Since each basket is mislabeled, focus on the "Apples and Oranges" basket. Start by pulling a fruit from this one!
