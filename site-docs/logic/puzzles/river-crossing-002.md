**The River Crossing Puzzle**

A farmer needs to cross a river with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. The farmer has a small boat that can only carry the farmer and one of the three at a time (either the wolf, the goat, or the cabbage). If left alone together:
- The wolf will eat the goat.
- The goat will eat the cabbage.

The farmer must figure out how to get all three safely across the river without any of them being eaten.

**Question:**  
How can the farmer successfully get the wolf, goat, and cabbage across the river?

**Hint:**  
Think about how the farmer can prevent leaving the wolf and goat, or the goat and cabbage together on either side of the river.
