# Turtle and the Hare Solution

**Solution:**

## 1. **Understanding the Scenario:**

- The hare is faster than the turtle, but he becomes overconfident and takes a nap during the race.
- The turtle moves steadily without stopping.

## 2. **The Hare’s Mistake:**

   - The hare’s decision to nap represents a critical error. While he is resting, the turtle is still moving forward.
   - By the time the hare wakes up and resumes running, the turtle has gained a significant lead.

## 3. **The Turtle’s Advantage:**
   - The turtle’s steady pace means that he is continuously making progress toward the finish line.
   - Because the turtle doesn’t stop, he is always advancing, while the hare’s pause gives the turtle a chance to overtake.

## 4. **The Final Outcome:**

   - The hare’s speed alone is not enough to guarantee victory if he doesn’t maintain consistent progress.
   - The turtle wins because he persists and never stops, allowing him to cross the finish line before the hare can catch up.
